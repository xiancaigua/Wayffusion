# Recent Applied Modifications

## Theme A: Evaluation-time visualization and recording

Implemented:

- `headless` / `no-headless` toggles on training entrypoints
- shared evaluation recording for `PPO`, `SAC`, `TD3`, and `BC`
- unified `gif/mp4` export through `utils/evaluation.py`
- `eval_media_dir` tracking in evaluation outputs

Design choice:

- live rendering and recording are limited to evaluation episodes
- the rollout collector is not rendered frame by frame

## Theme B: Stable render path for media generation

Implemented:

- `rgb_array` rendering uses a NumPy image path
- `human` mode keeps interactive visualization

Reason:

- recording should not depend on a GUI backend
- the previous matplotlib backend path was fragile on some local runs

## Theme C: Timestamped training output roots

Implemented:

- all training outputs now go to `outputs/training/<algorithm>/<timestamp>/<run_name>/`
- the timestamp layer is built through a shared helper

Reason:

- repeated runs no longer overwrite each other
- per-algorithm runs are easier to audit and compare

## Theme D: Sibling directories for checkpoints and snapshots

Implemented:

- model weights are stored under `checkpoints/`
- training-start material is stored under `snapshot/`

Reason:

- start state and trained state are now explicitly separated
- `media/`, `checkpoints/`, `snapshot/`, and `tensorboard/` live at the same level

## Theme E: PPO stop contract

Implemented:

- `scripts/train_ppo.py` supports both `--total_updates` and `--target_episodes`
- the multitask PPO launcher defaults to update-based stopping

Reason:

- supports classic PPO training by update count
- still keeps episode-budget control when needed

## Theme F: Multitask PPO launcher

Implemented:

- `configs/policy/ppo_cnn_deepsets_multitask_20k.yaml`
- `scripts/run_multitask_ppo_20k.ps1`

Current default:

- task interleaving over `goal_nav coverage formation risk_nav`
- centralized PPO
- `CNN + DeepSets`
- update-based stopping

## Theme G: Expanded tests

Added coverage for:

- media export
- non-headless human render path
- timestamped training paths
- snapshot and recursive checkpoint lookup
- PPO target-episode early stop
- agent memory module loading

## Theme H: TensorBoard and live console feedback

Implemented:

- shared TensorBoard event writing for `PPO`, `SAC`, `TD3`, and `BC`
- periodic console progress lines during training
- final evaluation summaries written to TensorBoard
- per-run `tensorboard/` directory under every training output

Design choice:

- TensorBoard is attached to the same run root as checkpoints and media
- console logging is emitted on the trainer's native progress axis: update, step, or epoch

## Theme I: Agent memory synchronization rule

Implemented:

- `agent_memory/README.md` now states a mandatory synchronization rule
- new `maintenance_protocol` card formalizes the process contract

Rule:

- every code, config, doc, CLI, or output-contract change must update `agent_memory/` in the same task

## Theme J: Core credibility repair for scaling, policy math, and ablation semantics

Implemented:

- `waypoint_controller(...)` now clips against `map_size`, not a hard-coded unit square
- `density_preserving` runs can now move into coordinates larger than `1.0`
- `MLP`, `CNN + DeepSets`, and `Attention` policies now use tanh-squashed Gaussian action sampling with corrected log-prob evaluation
- formation radius mismatch is now represented as a positive error with an explicit negative penalty term
- canonical ablation naming is now `no_spatial_field`, while `task_id_only` remains a deprecated alias
- reference normalization now marks unstable anchors and preserves raw-return / anchor metadata more explicitly

Reason:

- these were benchmark-trust issues, not cosmetic cleanups
- cross-`N` evaluation and policy-gradient math are now aligned with the intended centralized benchmark contract

## Trusted conclusion

These changes are no longer isolated patches. They now exist consistently in:

- code
- docs
- tests
- output contract
- operational memory

That combination should be treated as the current engineering source of truth.

## Theme K: Chinese config reference and template config directory

Implemented:

- `docs/config_reference_zh.md` was refreshed into a script-oriented Chinese config guide
- `configs/examples/` now contains ready-to-copy template files for env, policy, and eval categories
- a lightweight parser test now guards the template directory against drift

Reason:

- users now have a single Chinese entrypoint for understanding config categories
- new experiments can start from stable templates instead of mutating old run configs blindly

## Theme L: PPO evaluation now runs per-task instead of only mixed-sampler averages

Implemented:

- `utils/evaluation.py` now provides a fixed-task `evaluate_policy_per_task(...)` helper
- PPO periodic evaluation now records per-task metrics plus an overall summary
- PPO final evaluation now writes per-task rows and an `overall` row into `eval_metrics.csv`
- TensorBoard final-eval namespaces now include per-task paths such as `ppo/final_eval/N4/goal_nav/...`

Reason:

- a multi-task training run should not hide a collapsed task behind one mixed average
- per-task regressions are now visible during training and in saved evaluation tables

## Theme M: Per-task evaluation propagated to eval scripts and off-policy trainers

Implemented:

- `scripts/evaluate_policy.py` now writes per-task rows plus an `overall` row
- `scripts/evaluate_scaling.py` now writes per-task rows plus an `overall` row for every evaluated `N`
- `SAC` and `TD3` periodic evaluation now flatten per-task metrics into training records
- `SAC` and `TD3` final eval now mirror PPO with per-task TensorBoard namespaces and per-task `eval_metrics.csv`
- variable-`N` PPO periodic evaluation now monitors all requested `N`, not just the first one
- restored minimal default configs for `configs/policy/sac_cnn_deepsets.yaml` and `configs/policy/td3_cnn_deepsets.yaml` so the touched training scripts keep a valid default entrypoint

Reason:

- trust-worthy evaluation should expose both task-level failures and cross-`N` failures
- fixed-task breakdowns are now consistent across online training logs, eval scripts, and saved CSV outputs

## Theme N: Ubuntu Docker server training adaptation

Implemented:

- added `requirements-server.txt` for PyTorch Docker images that already provide CUDA-enabled torch
- kept the existing `requirements.txt` as the generic environment file and added the missing `psutil` dependency there
- added `docs/server_training_zh.md` with Docker launch, proxy verification, dependency installation, GPU checks, smoke tests, TensorBoard forwarding, long-run training, and common troubleshooting
- added `scripts/server/check_server_env.py` for offline server environment diagnostics
- added `scripts/server/smoke_train_ppo.sh` for a short headless PPO training and GIF-recording check
- added `scripts/server/start_tensorboard.sh` for the canonical `outputs/training` TensorBoard logdir
- added a README entry pointing server users to the dedicated guide
- extended `.gitignore` so server-side test runs do not leave Python cache files as untracked worktree noise

Reason:

- the target server image is `pytorch/pytorch:2.7.0-cuda12.8-cudnn9-devel`, so server installs must avoid upgrading torch through pip
- server training must remain headless and preserve the existing `outputs/training/<algorithm>/<timestamp>/<run_name>/` artifact layout
- `utils/profiling.py` imports `psutil`, so server and generic dependency files now declare it explicitly

## Theme O: Long all-task PPO training launcher

Implemented:

- added `scripts/run_ppo_all_tasks_long.sh` as the Linux/Ubuntu launcher for long PPO training across `goal_nav coverage formation risk_nav`
- default run uses `configs/policy/ppo_cnn_deepsets_multitask_20k.yaml`, `total_updates=2000`, `target_episodes=0`, `eval_episodes=5`, and `agent_counts=4`
- periodic evaluation and checkpointing follow the config's PPO `eval_interval` of 25 updates
- GIF recording is enabled with `record_eval_episodes=1` and `record_interval=4`, so media is saved every 100 updates plus final evaluation media
- script defaults to headless training, TensorBoard enabled, `MPLBACKEND=Agg`, and `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0`, while allowing shell environment overrides
- script has a top-level editable `DEFAULT_*` configuration block so normal parameter changes can be made inside the `.sh` file
- README now points Linux users to the long all-task launcher

Reason:

- server users need one direct command for long all-task PPO training that preserves the existing artifact contract
- checkpoints, TensorBoard logs, evaluation CSVs, and GIFs continue to live under `outputs/training/ppo/<timestamp>/<run_name>/`

## Theme S: goal_nav remaining-goal observability and conservative PPO diagnostics

Implemented:

- `tasks/goal_nav.py` and `tasks/risk_nav.py` now rebuild the `goal_reward` field from only unreached goals each step instead of keeping a static reset-time goal map
- `tests/test_rewards_basic.py` now checks that goal-progress shaping ignores goals already marked as reached
- `algorithms/ppo.py` now clamps `log_std` both at trainer init and after checkpoint load, and logs rollout reward stats, terminal metrics, KL/clip diagnostics, ratio mean, gradient norm, explained variance, and policy std summaries
- `utils/evaluation.py` now accumulates episode-level reward components into eval records for deeper reward audits

Reason:

- goal-nav specialists were repeatedly re-attracted to already completed goals
- conservative PPO fine-tunes need explicit `log_std` enforcement after loading BC checkpoints
- long-horizon debug work needed richer diagnostics than `eval_reward` / `eval_success_rate` alone

## Theme T: goal_nav specialist repair via success-trajectory BC, DAgger BC, and ultra-strict PPO

Implemented:

- added goal-nav debug configs:
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_goal_nav.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_goal_nav_success.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_goal_nav_controlled.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_goal_nav_bc_finetune.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_goal_nav_bc_finetune_strict.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_goal_nav_dagger_finetune_ultra_strict.yaml`
- `scripts/train_bc.py` now accepts `--init_checkpoint` so BC can be warm-started from previous BC or PPO checkpoints during DAgger-style repair loops
- `outputs/debug_long/20260528_035433/` now records the success-only BC run, BC+PPO fine-tune, DAgger dataset collection, and DAgger BC retrain

Current best evidence:

- success-only DAgger BC run:
  - `outputs/training/bc/20260528_051955/debug_bc_goal_nav_success_goal_nav_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`
  - final `success_rate_mean=0.8`
  - final `goal_coverage_ratio_mean=0.9125`
  - final `collision_rate_mean=0.0646`
- ultra-strict PPO fine-tune from the DAgger BC checkpoint:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260528_goalnav_dagger_finetune_ultra_strict/goalnav_dagger_finetune_ultra_strict/`
  - final `success_rate_mean=0.8`

## Theme AC: coverage centralized per-agent waypoint allocation experiments

Implemented:

- `CNNDeepSetsPolicy` now has an optional `coverage_utility_slot_head`, disabled by default.
- The new head reads the centralized multi-channel field and adds a small per-agent waypoint bias from a pooled coverage utility grid.
- The head keeps the same action contract: output is still `[B, N, 2]`, log-prob remains one joint log-prob per env, and `agent_mask` still zeros padded agents.
- `policies/__init__.py` forwards the new config fields.
- `tests/test_variable_policies.py` now checks the utility slot head and cross-task compatibility.
- New configs:
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_utilityslot.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_utilityslot_ultra_strict.yaml`

Diagnostic result:

- Direct untrained utility-slot behavior was bad (`coverage_ratio_mean≈0.314`, high collision), so the head is not a standalone heuristic.
- BC on `coverage_success_from_phase24_best_round4.npz` produced:
  - run: `outputs/training/bc/20260530_025202/debug_bc_coverage_utilityslot_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`
  - `success_rate_mean=0.10`
  - `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.666`
  - `collision_rate_mean≈0.000375`
- PPO fine-tune `phase27_coverage_utilityslot` was stopped at update 40 because eval stayed at `success_rate=0.0`.

Conclusion:

- A fixed coverage utility bias can preserve low collision after BC, but it destabilizes PPO fine-tuning.
- Do not continue this exact fixed-bias branch unless the bias is made learnable or much weaker.

## Theme AD: coverage expert-v3 local frontier teacher

Implemented:

- `scripts/debug_long/generate_coverage_expert_v2_dataset.py` now also exposes `CoverageExpertV3` and `--expert v3`.
- `CoverageExpertV3` uses local remaining-demand frontier selection plus short-range collision-avoidance repulsion.
- `scripts/debug_long/generate_success_expert_dataset.py` now supports:
  - `--teacher coverage_expert_v2`
  - `--teacher coverage_expert_v3`

Diagnostic result:

- `CoverageExpertV2` diagnostic: `success=0.0`, `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.538`, high collision.
- local frontier without repulsion: `success≈0.0625`, `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.645`, but collision was too high.
- `CoverageExpertV3` with repulsion: `success≈0.07`, `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.622`, `collision≈0.0041`.

Conclusion:

- `CoverageExpertV3` is not a solved expert, but it is a better source of successful coverage trajectories than `CoverageExpertV2`.
- Next coverage branch should collect success-only v3 trajectories, then train BC/PPO from that dataset.

## Theme AE: coverage permutation-invariant BC breakthrough

Implemented:

- `algorithms/bc.py` now supports optional `permutation_invariant_loss`.
- The loss works in waypoint space, not raw action space:
  - predicted waypoint = current position + predicted action * `bc_waypoint_step`
  - expert waypoint = current position + expert action * `bc_waypoint_step`
  - all target waypoint assignments are enumerated for small N, and the minimum assignment loss is used
- `scripts/train_bc.py` injects `bc_waypoint_step` from the env config into BC config.
- Added `tests/test_bc_permutation_loss.py`.
- Added `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_successonly_perm.yaml`.
- Added `scripts/debug_long/merge_expert_datasets.py` for atomic NPZ dataset merges.

Data generated:

- `outputs/debug_long/20260530_coverage_expert_v3/coverage_expert_v3_success_N4_e40.npz`
  - 40 successful episodes
  - 7354 samples
  - 665 attempts
  - mean successful collision rate: `0.0`
- `outputs/debug_long/20260530_coverage_expert_v3/coverage_success_round4_plus_v3_e40.npz`
  - merged samples: 17162
  - inputs:
    - phase24 round4 success data: 9808 samples
    - v3 success data: 7354 samples

Key result:

- permutation-invariant BC run:
  - `outputs/training/bc/20260530_032314/debug_bc_coverage_successonly_perm_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`
  - `success_rate_mean=0.25`
  - `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.717`
  - `collision_rate_mean≈0.0079`
  - `return_mean≈10.61`

Conclusion:

- Coverage BC was materially harmed by fixed-index expert action matching.
- The current best coverage specialist checkpoint is now the permutation-invariant BC checkpoint, pending PPO fine-tune.
  - final `goal_coverage_ratio_mean=0.9425`
  - final `collision_rate_mean=0.0275`
  - final `return_mean=10.1225`

Reason:

- naive PPO from scratch on goal_nav showed nonzero intermediate improvements but repeatedly fell back to `success_rate≈0`
- BC from generic heuristic data improved alignment but not enough robustness
- DAgger-style relabeling on learner states produced the first specialist line that stayed in a high-success region under PPO

## Theme U: coverage specialist controlled-PPO branch and BC probe

Implemented:

- added coverage debug configs:
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_controlled.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_bc_finetune.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_long_horizon.yaml`
- generated heuristic expert dataset:
  - `outputs/datasets/expert_coverage_N4_phase3_e80.npz`
- trained BC coverage probe:
  - `outputs/training/bc/20260528_072926/debug_bc_coverage_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`

Current status:

- best PPO controlled coverage line so far comes from:
  - `outputs/training/ppo/20260528_phase2_coverage_controlled/phase2_coverage_controlled/`
  - `eval_coverage_coverage_ratio≈0.447`
  - `eval_reward≈-1.29`
  - `eval_success_rate=0.0`
- resumed controlled PPO under:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260528_phase3_coverage_controlled_resume/phase3_coverage_controlled_resume/`
  - resumed improving after an early dip, but still had `eval_success_rate=0.0`
- BC coverage probe underperformed the PPO controlled line:
  - final `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.406`
  - final `success_rate_mean=0.0`
  - final `collision_rate_mean≈0.211`

Reason:

- coverage is not “randomly failing”; PPO can learn meaningful partial coverage behavior
- however, heuristic BC alone does not currently beat the best PPO controlled checkpoint
- next coverage work should prioritize long-horizon PPO tuning over generic heuristic BC

## Theme V: goal_nav convergence confirmation and coverage credit-assignment branch

Implemented:

- confirmed the DAgger BC -> ultra-strict PPO chain all the way through final eval:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260528_goalnav_dagger_finetune_ultra_strict/goalnav_dagger_finetune_ultra_strict/eval_metrics.csv`
- added a faster coverage long-horizon / credit-assignment PPO config:
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_creditassign.yaml`
- launched a resumed coverage run from the best phase-3 checkpoint:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260528_phase4_coverage_creditassign/phase4_coverage_creditassign/`

Current best confirmed goal_nav result:

- final `return_mean=10.1225`
- final `normalized_score_mean=1.0496`
- final `success_rate_mean=0.8`
- final `collision_rate_mean=0.0275`
- final `goal_coverage_ratio_mean=0.9425`

Current coverage status:

- heuristic BC probe stays weaker than PPO:
  - `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.406`
  - `success_rate_mean=0.0`
  - `collision_rate_mean≈0.211`
- coverage credit-assignment PPO currently has early eval points:
  - update 20: `eval_reward≈-0.551`, `coverage_ratio≈0.450`, `collision≈0.0899`, `success=0.0`
  - update 40: `eval_reward≈-1.008`, `coverage_ratio≈0.449`, `collision≈0.0944`, `success=0.0`

Reason:

- goal_nav is now strong enough to be treated as the current canonical specialist PPO success path
- coverage still needs iterative tuning, but the credit-assignment branch is now the best active mainline to continue from

## Theme W: coverage expert-v2 dataset and BC warm-start branch

Implemented:

- added `scripts/debug_long/generate_coverage_expert_v2_dataset.py`
- added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_expertv2_finetune_strict.yaml`
- generated stronger coverage expert dataset:
  - `outputs/debug_long/20260528_coverage_expert_v2/coverage_expert_v2_N4_e40.npz`
- trained BC on that dataset:
  - `outputs/training/bc/20260528_081939/debug_bc_coverage_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`
- launched strict PPO from the new BC checkpoint:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260528_phase6_coverage_expertv2_finetune/phase6_coverage_expertv2_finetune/`

Current evidence:

- quick expert-v2 probe over 5 episodes beat the canonical heuristic:
  - heuristic: `coverage_ratio≈0.420`, `collision≈0.130`, `intrinsic≈0.389`
  - expert-v2: `coverage_ratio≈0.579`, `collision≈0.0865`, `intrinsic≈0.555`
- BC trained on expert-v2 data also beat both the canonical heuristic BC and the PPO plateau:
  - final `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.512`
  - final `collision_rate_mean≈0.150`
  - final `return_mean≈-0.685`
  - final `normalized_score_mean≈1.532`

Reason:

- coverage heuristic BC from the canonical heuristic was not strong enough
- a stronger spread-aware expert policy produced the first clear coverage BC warm-start that surpassed the previous PPO coverage-ratio plateau

## Theme X: coverage coordination-repulsion PPO branch

Implemented:

- added optional `coordination_repulsion_strength` support to `policies/cnn_deepsets_policy.py`
- threaded the new config field through `policies/__init__.py`
- added coverage experiment configs:
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_expertv2_finetune_ultra_strict.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_expertv2_repulsion.yaml`
- added a minimal regression test:
  - `tests/test_variable_policies.py::test_cnn_deepsets_policy_supports_optional_coordination_repulsion`

Current evidence:

- the plain ultra-strict PPO fine-tune from the expert-v2 BC checkpoint still degraded to about `coverage_ratio≈0.486`
- enabling repulsion bias produced the first clear post-BC PPO jump:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260528_phase8_coverage_repulsion/phase8_coverage_repulsion/`
  - update 20: `coverage_ratio≈0.578`
  - update 20: `collision_rate≈0.0015`
  - update 20: `eval_reward≈5.397`
  - success is still `0.0`, so this is not yet full task convergence

Reason:

- coverage PPO had repeatedly plateaued near the heuristic structure ceiling
- a small explicit anti-crowding bias appears to help the factorized per-agent actor preserve spatial spread instead of collapsing back into redundant overlap

## Theme Y: coverage repulsion branch follow-up with reward-focus resume

Implemented:

- added `configs/env/debug_coverage_reward_focus.yaml`
- resumed a repulsion PPO checkpoint under the reward-focus coverage env:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260528_phase9_coverage_repulsion_rewardfocus/phase9_coverage_repulsion_rewardfocus/`

Current evidence:

- the plain repulsion PPO branch remains the strongest PPO coverage line so far:
  - peak `coverage_ratio≈0.664`
  - `collision≈0.001`
  - one eval point reached `success_rate=0.05`
- adding reward-focus on top of the repulsion checkpoint did not further increase the coverage ratio:
  - update 20 under phase 9: `coverage_ratio≈0.665`
  - update 20 under phase 9: `success=0.0`

Reason:

- coverage reward scaling alone is not the main remaining blocker once anti-crowding coordination is in place
- the remaining gap now looks more like “last-mile completion behavior” than generic reward sparsity

## Theme Z: coverage spatial-action-head specialist branch

Implemented:

- extended `CNNDeepSetsPolicy` with optional:
  - `use_spatial_action_head`
  - `spatial_action_strength`
- added `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_spatialhead.yaml`
- added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_spatialhead_ultra_strict.yaml`
- trained a stronger coverage BC warm-start with expert-v2 data and the new spatial action head:
  - `outputs/training/bc/20260528_092949/debug_bc_coverage_spatialhead_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`
- launched PPO from that checkpoint:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260528_phase10_coverage_spatialhead_ultra/phase10_coverage_spatialhead_ultra/`

Current evidence:

- spatial-head BC outperformed the prior coverage BC:
  - `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.661`
  - `success_rate_mean≈0.05`
  - `collision_rate_mean≈0.00094`
  - `return_mean≈8.659`
- spatial-head ultra-strict PPO then preserved and slightly improved that structure:
  - update 20: `success≈0.10`, `coverage_ratio≈0.667`, `collision≈0.000625`
  - update 40: `success≈0.10`, `coverage_ratio≈0.670`, `collision≈0.0003125`
  - update 60: `success≈0.10`, `coverage_ratio≈0.682`, `collision≈0.00025`
  - final eval:
    - `return_mean≈8.083`
    - `normalized_score_mean≈2.615`
    - `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.667`
    - `success_rate_mean=0.0`
    - `collision_rate_mean≈0.003`

Reason:

- coverage needed a stronger geometric inductive bias than plain per-agent decoder plus repulsion alone
- an explicit spatial action head helps the actor map each agent to a spatial target instead of only producing raw waypoint deltas

## Theme AA: coverage spatial-target suppression probe

Implemented:

- added non-parametric `spatial_target_suppression_strength` and `spatial_target_suppression_sigma` support inside the spatial action head
- added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_spatialhead_suppression.yaml`
- verified the new branch with `tests/test_variable_policies.py`

Current evidence:

- suppression branch did not beat the plain spatial-head PPO branch:
  - update 20: `success≈0.10`, `coverage_ratio≈0.655`, `collision≈0.00044`
  - update 40: `success≈0.05`, `coverage_ratio` and reward both slipped relative to the no-suppression branch

Reason:

- explicit soft suppression was a reasonable next guess for target diversity
- but in current form it underperforms the simpler spatial-head + repulsion branch, so it should not replace the current mainline

## Theme AB: interruption-safe debug artifact writing

Implemented:

- `scripts/debug_long/collect_success_policy_dataset.py`
- `scripts/debug_long/collect_dagger_dataset.py`
- `scripts/debug_long/generate_success_expert_dataset.py`
- `scripts/debug_long/generate_coverage_expert_v2_dataset.py`

now write datasets and JSON sidecars via temporary files plus atomic rename.

Reason:

- long-running debug jobs were being interrupted by connection drops or accidental thread closure
- partial `.npz` writes were leaving corrupted datasets such as `BadZipFile`
- atomic write semantics keep the final path either fully valid or absent

## Theme AC: risk_nav and formation specialist repair

Implemented:

- added risk-nav configs:
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_risk_nav_success.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_risk_nav_success_ultra_strict.yaml`
- added formation configs:
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_formation_success.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_formation_success_ultra_strict.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_formation_dagger.yaml`
- generated success-only datasets:
  - `outputs/debug_long/20260528_risk_nav_success/risk_nav_success_N4_stride2.npz`
  - `outputs/debug_long/20260528_formation_success/formation_success_N4_stride2.npz`
- generated formation success-policy dataset:
  - `outputs/debug_long/20260528_formation_success_policy/formation_success_from_phase14_u40_plus_fullheuristic.npz`

Current evidence:

- risk_nav:
  - BC on full heuristic-state dataset reached `success_rate_mean≈0.55`
  - ultra-strict PPO from that BC checkpoint stabilized around `success≈0.55~0.60`
  - final line:
    - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260528_phase13_risk_nav_ultra/phase13_risk_nav_ultra/`
    - final `success_rate_mean=0.6`
    - final `goal_coverage_ratio_mean≈0.829`
    - final `collision_rate_mean≈0.049`
- formation:
  - success-only BC remained below heuristic
  - full-state BC improved but still lagged heuristic
  - ultra-strict PPO from the full-state BC checkpoint reached the first stable heuristic-level line:
    - update 40/60/80 held `success≈0.4`
    - final eval fell back to `success=0.3`
  - formation DAgger BC and formation success-policy BC did not beat that PPO branch

Reason:

- risk_nav was close enough to goal_nav that the BC -> strict PPO recipe transferred well
- formation responds to the current slot-aware actor and PPO warm-start, but its best result is still a best-checkpoint result rather than a final stabilized result

## Theme AD: human-readable summary doc and formation success-policy PPO branch

Implemented:

- added human-readable summary doc:
  - `docs/specialist_training_repair_summary_zh.md`
- launched formation success-policy PPO branch:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260528_phase16_formation_successpolicy_ultra/phase16_formation_successpolicy_ultra/`

Current evidence:

- the doc now records:
  - what changed
  - why each code/config change was made
  - which task is currently repaired vs partially repaired
  - why conservative PPO / BC / DAgger / structure bias were technically justified
- formation success-policy PPO first eval currently holds:
  - update 20: `success≈0.4`
  - `formation_error≈0.091`
  - `collision≈0.0045`

Reason:

- the user explicitly requested a human-facing written summary under `docs/`
- frequent connection drops mean partial-but-important experimental state should be written to memory before runs finish

## Theme AE: coverage success-trajectory reinforcement follow-up

Implemented:

- collected additional coverage success-policy datasets:
  - deterministic from `phase10` update 60
  - deterministic from `phase10` update 40
  - noisy (`action_noise_std=0.05`) from `phase10` update 60
- tested several follow-up branches:
  - `phase15_coverage_successbc_ultra`
  - `phase17_coverage_sectorbias_ultra`
  - `phase18_coverage_stronger_repulsion`
- added optional `sector_target_bias_strength` and optional `use_global_slot_head` / `global_slot_strength`
- trained `debug_bc_coverage_globalslot`

Current evidence:

- success-policy dataset collected from `phase10` policy remained sparse:
  - deterministic `u60`: only `2` successful episodes over `240` attempts
  - deterministic `u40`: `0` successful episodes over `240` attempts
  - noisy `u60 + noise 0.05`: still only `2` successful episodes over `240` attempts
- `phase15_coverage_successbc_ultra` underperformed the plain `phase10` branch
- `phase17_coverage_sectorbias_ultra` underperformed the plain spatial-head branch
- `debug_bc_coverage_globalslot` underperformed the best `spatialhead BC`

Reason:

- the current coverage PPO line can enter the success region, but the success basin is still narrow and brittle
- adding weak success-only data is not enough by itself
- current lightweight group-level approximations have not yet surpassed the simpler spatial-head PPO branch

## Theme AF: risk_nav repaired and formation pushed to heuristic-level PPO

Implemented:

- generated success-only heuristic dataset for `risk_nav`
- trained full-state BC and ultra-strict PPO:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260528_phase13_risk_nav_ultra/phase13_risk_nav_ultra/`
- generated success-only and full-state datasets for `formation`
- trained formation BC / PPO / DAgger BC / success-policy BC branches

Current evidence:

- `risk_nav` final line is now stable and reusable:
  - final `success_rate_mean=0.6`
  - final `goal_coverage_ratio_mean≈0.829`
  - final `collision_rate_mean≈0.049`
- `formation` best PPO line remains:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260528_phase14_formation_ultra/phase14_formation_ultra/`
  - stable mid-run `success≈0.4`
  - final `success≈0.3`
- later formation success-policy / DAgger BC branches did not exceed that line

Reason:

- `risk_nav` transferred well from the `goal_nav` repair recipe
- `formation` benefits from structure-aware actor heads, but still does not hold its best success level all the way to final eval

## Theme AG: optional global-slot actor branch with cross-task compatibility

Implemented:

- extended `CNNDeepSetsPolicy` with optional:
  - `use_global_slot_head`
  - `global_slot_strength`
- added a cross-task compatibility test:
  - `tests/test_variable_policies.py::test_cnn_deepsets_global_slot_head_is_compatible_across_tasks`
- verified the expanded policy test suite passes with `9 passed`

Reason:

- the user explicitly required that any new task-allocation architecture remain compatible with the old centralized policy path
- the new group-level allocation branch therefore stays optional, default-off, and is now minimally validated across `goal_nav`, `coverage`, `formation`, and `risk_nav`

## Theme AH: PPO best-eval checkpoint preservation

Implemented:

- `algorithms/ppo.py` now saves:
  - `checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt`
  - `best_eval_summary.json`
- `scripts/train_ppo.py` variable-`N` loop mirrors the same behavior

Selection rule:

- prefer higher `eval_success_rate`
- break ties with higher `eval_reward`

Reason:

- `coverage` and `formation` often hit their best success mid-run and then drift downward by final eval
- preserving the best eval checkpoint avoids losing the most useful specialist snapshot just because the final checkpoint is worse

## Theme AI: final eval now prefers best PPO checkpoint

Implemented:

- `scripts/train_ppo.py` now accepts `--final_eval_source best|last`
- default is `best`
- if `checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt` exists, final per-task evaluation loads that checkpoint before writing `eval_metrics.csv`
- final eval rows now include `final_eval_source`

Reason:

- coverage and formation repeatedly showed “mid-run best, final worse”
- selecting the best checkpoint for final reporting is a pragmatic engineering fix that turns an unstable tail into a usable specialist artifact without changing the training update rule itself

## Theme AJ: coverage success-only reinforcement deepening

Implemented:

- collected a stronger success-heavy coverage dataset from `phase10` update 80 over a better seed window:
  - `outputs/debug_long/20260529_coverage_success_policy/coverage_success_from_phase10_u80_seed5000_plus_expertv2.npz`
  - `successful_episodes=15`
- extracted / iterated success-only mixes:
  - `coverage_success_only_from_phase10_u80_seed5000.npz`
  - `coverage_success_from_successBC_e40.npz`
  - `coverage_success_from_successBC_e40_round2.npz`
  - `coverage_success_from_successBC_e40_round3.npz`
- trained successive success-heavy BC refinements:
  - `outputs/training/bc/20260529_015503/...`
  - `outputs/training/bc/20260529_021428/...`
  - `outputs/training/bc/20260529_051145/...`
  - `outputs/training/bc/20260529_155058/...`

Current evidence:

- the first success-heavy BC pushed coverage BC success from `0.05` to `0.10`
- the next strengthened success-heavy BC pushed it further to:
  - `return_mean≈9.697`
  - `normalized_score_mean≈2.814`
  - `success_rate_mean≈0.15`
  - `collision_rate_mean≈0.0`
- PPO launched from these stronger success-only BC checkpoints (`phase20`, `phase23`) still did not exceed the `phase21 best` coverage PPO line

Reason:

- coverage success behavior can be partially reinforced through data, but the gain saturates before PPO turns that into a clearly better final specialist
- this suggests the remaining bottleneck is no longer “missing success examples” alone

## Theme AK: true group-level coverage actor candidates

Implemented:

- added optional `use_global_spatial_slot_head` / `global_spatial_slot_strength`
- added optional `actor_mean_residual_weight`
- added configs and probes for:
  - `global-slot BC`
  - `global-slot PPO`
  - `sector-bias PPO`
  - `slot-dominant BC`
- expanded `tests/test_variable_policies.py` to cover:
  - global slot head
  - slot-dominant actor
  - global-slot compatibility across tasks

Current evidence:

- `global-slot BC` and `slot-dominant BC` did not beat the best `spatial-head BC`
- `phase26_coverage_gspatialslot_bestfinal` first eval is still only `success≈0.05`
- the best coverage line remains the simpler `spatial-head PPO` branch with best-final checkpoint selection

Reason:

- lightweight group-level extensions are now present and compatible, but they have not yet beaten the current best coverage mainline
- further progress on coverage likely needs a stronger, more explicit group-level coordination design rather than another small bias term

## Theme P: Sequential PPO task-combination queue launcher

Implemented:

- added `scripts/run_ppo_task_queue.sh` for sequential PPO training over editable task-combination rows
- each queue row has its own label, task list, agent counts, update budget, eval episodes, GIF recording cadence, GPU selection, and extra CLI args
- queue runs remain headless, use TensorBoard, preserve `outputs/training/ppo/<timestamp>/<run_name>/`, and write queue logs under `outputs/training/task_queue/<timestamp>/`
- completion notification targets `muadib@foxmail.com` by default and supports SMTP env vars or local `mail` / `mailx` / `sendmail`
- `NOTIFY_ONLY=1` can now be used to test the notification path without starting training
- README now includes the queue launcher entrypoint

Reason:

- task-combination sweeps need repeatable sequential execution without manually starting every PPO run
- per-row parameters make it practical to debug different task mixes and hyperparameter variants while keeping the existing PPO training contract

## Theme Q: Core code explanatory comments

Implemented:

- added explanatory docstrings and comments to `envs/centralized_env.py` around centralized environment setup, observation/action contracts, runtime scaling, state initialization, task-field composition, transition stepping, collision handling, reward composition, and info metrics
- added comments to `algorithms/ppo.py` explaining rollout storage, reward normalization, critic bootstrap, GAE, minibatch flattening, clipped PPO ratios, and loss components
- added neural-network comments to `policies/cnn_deepsets_policy.py`, `policies/attention_policy.py`, and `policies/mlp_policy.py` describing architecture roles, variable-N handling, token/pooling logic, and centralized value/action heads
- added distribution comments to `policies/action_distribution.py` explaining tanh-squashed Gaussian actions and log-prob change-of-variables correction

Reason:

- future readers need the environment, algorithm, and policy framework to be understandable without reverse-engineering every tensor transformation
- comments document intent and contracts only; no algorithm semantics or training outputs were changed

## Theme R: Threaded environment batch backend

Implemented:

- added `ThreadEnvBatch` beside `SyncEnvBatch` in `utils/vector_env.py`, using `ThreadPoolExecutor` while preserving the same `envs`, `num_envs`, `reset(...)`, and `step(actions)` interface
- kept `SyncEnvBatch` behavior unchanged as the serial debug baseline
- extended `make_env_batch(...)` with `backend="sync|thread"` and optional `max_workers`
- added `make_task_balanced_env_batch(...)` to create a fixed number of environments per task with deterministic per-env seeds
- exported `ThreadEnvBatch` and `make_task_balanced_env_batch` through `utils/__init__.py`
- added `--env_backend`, `--envs_per_task`, and `--env_workers` to PPO, SAC, and TD3 training entrypoints
- added tests for threaded reset/step shape, ordered result collection, done-time auto reset, task-balanced env counts, forced task assignment, and task-balanced thread stepping

Reason:

- rollout collection was previously serialized over environment instances, which limits throughput when environment work dominates policy inference
- task-balanced batches make multi-task rollout sampling explicit by creating equal fixed-task environment groups instead of relying only on stochastic task sampling
- default backend remains `sync`, so all existing training commands preserve their old behavior unless a caller opts into `thread`

## Theme S: PPO multi-task suite launcher with specialist policies

Implemented:

- added `scripts/run_ppo_multitask_suite.sh` as a dedicated PPO experiment suite launcher
- the suite explicitly trains four independent specialist policies: `goal_nav`, `coverage`, `formation`, and `risk_nav`
- the suite also trains selected multi-task policies for pairs, triples, and all four tasks
- important tunables are listed at the top of the script, including config paths, scaling mode, observation variant, total updates, eval episodes, GIF cadence, env backend, task-balanced env count, thread workers, GPU id, and email settings
- each queue row carries its own task mix and training/evaluation/backend/GPU parameters
- queue logs and summary CSVs are written under `outputs/training/ppo_multitask_suite/<timestamp>/`, while training artifacts preserve the standard `outputs/training/ppo/<timestamp>/<run_name>/` layout
- `NOTIFY_ONLY=1` can now be used to test the suite notification path without running the queue

Reason:

- comparing specialist single-task policies with multi-task policies requires running both families under one repeatable queue
- keeping all important parameters visible in the script makes server-side experiment editing practical without changing trainer code

## Theme T: Shorter PPO run directory names

Implemented:

- shortened `scripts/train_ppo.py` run names from `<config>_<full_task_names>_N<agents>_<obs_variant>` to `<config>_<compact_task_tag>_N<agents>`
- compact task tags use `goal`, `cov`, `form`, `risk`, and `all4` for the canonical four-task set
- removed observation variant from the PPO run directory name because it is already saved in `snapshot/cli_args.yaml`

Reason:

- long PPO run directory names were cumbersome on server runs and nested output paths
- the removed fields are still recoverable from run snapshots and CSV metadata, so shortening the directory name does not remove experiment provenance

## Theme U: Queue-level PPO output grouping

Implemented:

- added optional `--run_timestamp` and `--run_name` arguments to `scripts/train_ppo.py`
- `scripts/run_ppo_task_queue.sh` and `scripts/run_ppo_multitask_suite.sh` now pass their launch timestamp to every child PPO run
- queue row labels are passed as child PPO run names, producing output paths such as `outputs/training/ppo/<queue_timestamp>/<run_label>/...`

Reason:

- a scripted training suite should group all child runs under the script launch time instead of scattering them across many per-run timestamps
- queue labels are clearer than long auto-generated names when comparing many independent runs from one launch

## Theme V: QQ SMTP notification configuration

Implemented:

- queue scripts now support a QQ SMTP preset with defaults for `smtp.qq.com:465` over SSL
- sensitive mail values are loaded from environment variables or an ignored local file at `.secrets/wayffusion_mail.env`
- added `configs/examples/wayffusion_mail.env.example` as the safe template for local SMTP configuration
- `.gitignore` now excludes `.secrets/` and `wayffusion_mail.env`
- notification self-test remains available with `NOTIFY_ONLY=1`

Reason:

- email authorization codes must not be committed into scripts
- QQ/Foxmail SMTP requires an authorization code, so scripts now explicitly warn when `SMTP_USER` or `SMTP_PASSWORD` is missing

Follow-up validation:

- fixed SMTP variables loaded from `.secrets/wayffusion_mail.env` so they are explicitly passed into the Python mail sender subprocess
- verified `NOTIFY_ONLY=1` succeeds for both `scripts/run_ppo_multitask_suite.sh` and `scripts/run_ppo_task_queue.sh`

## Theme W: Queue script GPU selection inheritance

Implemented:

- updated `scripts/run_ppo_multitask_suite.sh` so `DEFAULT_CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` inherits an externally supplied `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
- changed the default suite rows to leave their per-row GPU field empty, allowing commands such as `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=5 bash scripts/run_ppo_multitask_suite.sh` to run on physical GPU 5
- kept per-row GPU override support intact; filling the row GPU field still takes precedence over the inherited default

Reason:

- hard-coded per-row `cuda_visible_devices=0` caused external GPU selection to be ignored
- server users need a simple launch-time way to choose a GPU without editing every queue row

## Theme X: Goal-nav reward alignment repair

Implemented:

- `tasks/goal_nav.py` and `tasks/risk_nav.py` now rebuild `goal_reward` from unreached goals only
- `goal_progress` and distance shaping now use remaining goals instead of all goals
- `tests/test_rewards_basic.py` now guards the remaining-goal shaping contract

Reason:

- the previous static field and all-goal shaping combination could keep already reached goals attractive and distort progress rewards
- this change aligns reward shaping with the intended completion objective without lowering the success threshold

## Theme Y: Goal-nav debug-long diagnostics and DAgger workflow

Implemented:

- added `outputs/debug_long/20260528_035433/` experiment records for takeover, PPO baselines, BC, diagnostics, and summaries
- added `scripts/debug_long/analyze_ppo_run.py` to summarize PPO CSVs
- added `scripts/debug_long/diagnose_goal_nav_policy.py` to measure deterministic action alignment against remaining goal peaks
- added `scripts/debug_long/generate_success_expert_dataset.py` to build a success-only goal_nav BC dataset
- added `scripts/debug_long/collect_dagger_dataset.py` to collect learner states and relabel them with heuristic expert actions
- added `configs/policy/debug_bc_goal_nav_success.yaml` for the success-only BC run

Reason:

- PPO from random initialization produced zero success and a near-zero deterministic mean action
- successful-trajectory BC improved action direction but still had brittle collisions, so DAgger-style learner-state relabeling became the next repair path

## Theme Z: BC warm-start and PPO fine-tune hooks for goal_nav

Implemented:

- `scripts/train_bc.py` now accepts `--init_checkpoint`
- `algorithms/ppo.py` now clamps `log_std` immediately after checkpoint load and at trainer init
- `configs/policy/debug_ppo_goal_nav_bc_finetune_strict.yaml` is used for conservative BC-to-PPO fine-tuning

Reason:

- BC and PPO now share a reproducible warm-start path
- keeping the exploration scale fixed during fine-tune avoids reintroducing the BC checkpoint's looser action variance

## Theme AF: coverage completion-focused reward diagnostic

Implemented on 2026-05-30:

- `tasks/coverage.py` now supports two default-off reward components:
  - `coverage_shortfall`: per-step shaping based on the gap between current `coverage_ratio` and the unchanged success threshold
  - `failure_penalty`: one terminal penalty when the episode reaches `max_steps` without coverage success
- the default/base coverage task behavior is unchanged unless those weights are present in the env config
- added `configs/env/debug_coverage_completion_focus.yaml`
- added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_perm_ref_completion.yaml`
- added `tests/test_rewards_basic.py::test_coverage_failure_penalty_only_on_unsuccessful_timeout`

Reason:

- latest coverage runs show the policy often plateaus around `coverage_ratio≈0.70` with low collision but below the fixed `0.82` success threshold
- old reward settings paid large cumulative `coverage_level_reward` to non-successful long episodes, so PPO could prefer stable near-threshold failure over early successful termination
- the diagnostic branch keeps the success threshold unchanged, reduces the incentive to idle at partial coverage, raises the success terminal signal, and explicitly penalizes timed-out non-success

Validation:

- `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_rewards_basic.py tests/test_bc_permutation_loss.py tests/test_variable_policies.py tests/test_ppo_episode_budget.py tests/test_expert_dataset.py`
- result: `22 passed`

Current coverage evidence before phase31:

- phase29 reference-regularized PPO best checkpoint:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase29_coverage_permref/phase29_coverage_permref/checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt`
  - 50-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.16`, `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.702`, `collision_rate_mean≈0.00035`
- phase29 self-success BC dataset and BC replay did not improve:
  - dataset: `outputs/debug_long/20260530_coverage_expert_v3/coverage_success_round4_v3_phase29.npz`
  - 50-episode eval of self-success BC: `success_rate_mean=0.08`, `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.708`, `collision_rate_mean≈0.000875`
  - conclusion: simply cloning phase29 successful episodes regresses toward average partial-coverage behavior

Next experiment:

- phase31 should warm-start from phase29 best checkpoint and use the completion-focused env config
- this is a labeled reward-shaping diagnostic, not a lowered-threshold success claim

Phase31 result:

- run root: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase31_coverage_completion/phase31_coverage_completion/`
- best checkpoint update: `90`
- 20-episode final/best eval: `success_rate_mean=0.30`, `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.720`, `collision_rate_mean≈0.00025`
- 50-episode best eval: `success_rate_mean=0.16`, `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.707`, `collision_rate_mean≈0.000226`
- conclusion: completion-focused reward fixes the objective semantics and maintains the 20-episode peak, but does not improve 50-episode robustness over phase29

Additional coverage expert diagnostics:

- added `CoverageExpertV4` in `scripts/debug_long/generate_coverage_expert_v2_dataset.py`
  - stateful sector assignment
  - persistent per-agent targets
  - short-range collision repulsion
- extended `scripts/debug_long/generate_success_expert_dataset.py --teacher` with `coverage_expert_v4`
- validation:
  - `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_expert_dataset.py tests/test_rewards_basic.py tests/test_bc_permutation_loss.py tests/test_variable_policies.py`
  - result: `21 passed`
- direct 80-episode V4 eval:
  - output: `outputs/debug_long/20260530_coverage_expert_v4/coverage_expert_v4_eval_e80.summary.json`
  - `success_rate=0.0`, `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.567`, `collision_rate_mean≈0.0161`
  - conclusion: V4 is worse than phase29 policy and should not be used for BC/PPO
- direct 80-episode band-sweep diagnostic:
  - output: `outputs/debug_long/20260530_coverage_band_sweep/band_sweep_eval_e80.summary.json`
  - `success_rate=0.0`, `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.596`, `collision_rate_mean≈0.0127`
  - conclusion: simple hand-coded lane/band sweep is not a viable teacher

Phase32 result:

- added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_perm_ref_completion_explore.yaml`
- run root: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase32_coverage_completion_explore/phase32_coverage_completion_explore/`
- warm-start: phase29 best checkpoint
- key change: higher exploration (`log_std≈-1.2`), lower reference regularization, 2 PPO epochs, small entropy bonus
- stopped manually after drift because best checkpoint was already saved:
  - best checkpoint update: `20`
  - 20-episode best eval: `success_rate_mean=0.35`
  - later eval drifted to `0.15` at update 50 and `0.10` at update 60
- 50-episode best eval:
  - `success_rate_mean=0.20`
  - `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.703`
  - `collision_rate_mean≈0.000125`
- conclusion: exploration can find slightly better coverage specialists than phase29/31, but the improvement is still weak and drifts without stronger stabilization

Phase33 result:

- added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_perm_ref_completion_stabilize.yaml`
- run root: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase33_coverage_completion_stabilize/phase33_coverage_completion_stabilize/`
- warm-start: phase32 best checkpoint
- key change: lower LR (`3e-6`), stronger reference regularization (`0.35`), lower fixed exploration than phase32
- training behavior:
  - update20 eval `success_rate=0.35`
  - update40 eval `success_rate=0.35`
  - no phase32-style collapse through update80
- 50-episode h200 best eval:
  - `success_rate_mean=0.20`
  - `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.707`
  - `collision_rate_mean≈0.000125`
- conclusion: phase33 stabilizes the 20-episode `0.35` peak but still only generalizes to `0.20` on h200

Horizon feasibility diagnostic:

- added `configs/env/debug_coverage_completion_focus_h300.yaml`
- this config keeps `coverage.success_ratio=0.82` unchanged but increases `max_steps` from 200 to 300
- same phase33 checkpoint evaluated under h300:
  - output: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase33_coverage_completion_stabilize/phase33_coverage_completion_stabilize/eval_best_50_h300_diagnostic/`
  - `success_rate_mean=0.48`
  - `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.769`
  - `collision_rate_mean≈0.000198`
- interpretation:
  - the h200 policy already knows a useful coverage behavior
  - many h200 failures are time/path-budget failures, because allowing more steps without lowering the threshold nearly doubles the 50-episode success rate
  - h300 is a diagnostic environment change and must not be mixed with h200 canonical results

Phase34 h300 PPO result:

- run root: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase34_coverage_h300_stabilize/phase34_coverage_h300_stabilize/`
- warm-start: phase33 best checkpoint
- env: `configs/env/debug_coverage_completion_focus_h300.yaml`
- best checkpoint update: `60`
- 20-episode best/final-source eval:
  - `success_rate_mean=0.65`
  - `collision_rate_mean=0.0`
- 50-episode best eval:
  - `success_rate_mean=0.56`
  - `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.770`
  - `collision_rate_mean≈0.000135`
  - `path_length_mean≈1.410`
- conclusion:
  - coverage PPO can train a substantially stronger expert when the horizon allows enough path budget
  - current h200 coverage remains unresolved; current h300 coverage is the strongest diagnostic specialist

## Theme AG: factorized group actor policy

Implemented on 2026-05-30:

- added `policies/factorized_group_policy.py`
- added `policy_class: factorized_group` to `policies/__init__.py`
- added configs:
  - `configs/policy/ppo_factorized_group.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_goal_nav_factorized_group.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_goal_nav_factorized_group_finetune.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_perm.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_h300.yaml`
- added tests in `tests/test_variable_policies.py`

Architecture contract:

- critic remains centralized and still consumes one global state feature
- actor remains shared across UAVs and still outputs `[B, N, 2]`
- a small bank of learned group tokens is conditioned on the global state
- each agent soft-assigns to those group tokens
- group tokens optionally select spatial slots from the field and feed both:
  - a per-agent group context into the actor decoder
  - a group-coordinate waypoint bias
- `agent_mask` and variable `N` stay supported
- PPO joint log-prob aggregation remains unchanged because the action head still emits one factorized `[N,2]` action tensor per env

Reason:

- the old `CNNDeepSetsPolicy` already had a shared per-agent decoder, but all agents received the same pooled swarm context
- this new policy inserts an explicit coordination layer between pooled state and per-agent action decoding, matching the requested “single-agent / small-group waypoint allocation under centralized information sharing” direction

Validation:

- `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_variable_policies.py tests/test_rewards_basic.py tests/test_bc_permutation_loss.py tests/test_expert_dataset.py`
- result after policy integration: `23 passed`
- final recheck after all edits:
  - `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_rewards_basic.py tests/test_expert_dataset.py tests/test_bc_permutation_loss.py tests/test_variable_policies.py tests/test_ppo_episode_budget.py`
  - result: `22 passed`

Goal-nav factorized-group specialist:

    - `goal_coverage_ratio_mean≈0.877`
    - `collision_rate_mean≈0.056`
- conclusion:
  - the new factorized-group policy can train a real PPO specialist expert on `goal_nav`
  - this de-risks the new decision architecture itself

Coverage factorized-group specialist:

- BC run:

  - old phase34 h300 50-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.56`, `coverage_ratio_mean≈0.770`, `collision_rate_mean≈0.000135`
- conclusion:
  - the new architecture is viable for coverage but is not yet the best-performing coverage policy
  - current factorized-group coverage issue is not “cannot train at all”; it is “path efficiency / stability still worse than old spatial-head line”

## Theme AH: factorized-group risk_nav and formation validation

Implemented on 2026-05-30:

- added new-architecture configs:
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_risk_nav_factorized_group.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_risk_nav_factorized_group_ultra_strict.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_formation_factorized_group.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_formation_factorized_group_ultra_strict.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_risk_nav_factorized_group_safe_ref.yaml`
- generated a risk low-collision diagnostic dataset:
  - `outputs/debug_long/20260530_risk_nav_factorized_group/risk_nav_success_lowcollision_N4_stride2.npz`
  - source: `outputs/debug_long/20260528_risk_nav_success/risk_nav_success_N4_stride2.npz`
  - kept `30 / 40` successful episodes with `collision_rate <= 0.02`
  - samples: `903`

Risk-nav factorized-group results:

- BC from original success dataset:
  - run root: `outputs/training/bc/20260530_095258/debug_bc_risk_nav_factorized_group_risk_nav_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`
  - 20-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.45`, `goal_coverage_ratio_mean≈0.633`, `collision_rate_mean≈0.139`
- PPO from that BC:
  - run root: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase38_risknav_factorized_group_ppo/phase38_risknav_factorized_group_ppo/`
  - 20-episode best/final-source eval: `success_rate_mean=0.45`, `collision_rate_mean≈0.129`
  - 50-episode best eval: `success_rate_mean=0.24`, `goal_coverage_ratio_mean≈0.570`, `collision_rate_mean≈0.177`
- safe/reference PPO diagnostic:
  - run root: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase40_risknav_factorized_group_safe_ref/phase40_risknav_factorized_group_safe_ref/`
  - stopped early after update 35 because eval stayed poor
  - best observed eval: `success_rate=0.15`
  - reason for failure: stronger repulsion and lower group bias degraded goal-reaching before it solved collisions
- low-collision-only BC:
  - run root: `outputs/training/bc/20260530_115519/debug_bc_risk_nav_factorized_group_risk_nav_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`
  - 20-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.05`, `collision_rate_mean≈0.240`
  - reason for failure: filtering removed too much state coverage; the model overfit a narrower success subset and generalized worse
- conclusion:
  - risk_nav is not repaired under `factorized_group`
  - current blocker is collision-heavy path behavior; imitation-only and simple repulsion/reference fixes were not enough
  - old CNNDeepSets risk specialist remains stronger (`50/20 eval success around 0.60`)

Formation factorized-group results:

- BC from DAgger/full-heuristic dataset:
  - run root: `outputs/training/bc/20260530_095515/debug_bc_formation_factorized_group_formation_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`
  - 20-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.50`, `formation_error_mean≈0.058`, `collision_rate_mean=0.0`
- PPO from that BC:
  - run root: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase39_formation_factorized_group_ppo/phase39_formation_factorized_group_ppo/`
  - 20-episode best/final-source eval: `success_rate_mean=0.50`, `collision_rate_mean=0.0`
  - 50-episode best eval: `success_rate_mean=0.44`, `formation_error_mean≈0.063`, `collision_rate_mean≈0.000825`
- comparison:
  - old formation best 20/final eval was around `success_rate_mean=0.35`
- conclusion:
  - formation is now provisionally repaired under `factorized_group`
  - PPO did not improve BC, but best-checkpoint preservation keeps a useful specialist

Validation:

- `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_variable_policies.py tests/test_rewards_basic.py tests/test_bc_permutation_loss.py tests/test_expert_dataset.py tests/test_ppo_episode_budget.py`
- result: `24 passed`

## Theme AI: factorized_group continuation after connection loss

Implemented / recorded:

- Added `outputs/debug_long/20260530_factorized_group_continuation/00_takeover.md` as the recovery record for the current continuation.
- Added `configs/env/debug_risk_nav_safety_completion.yaml`, a reward-only risk-nav diagnostic/training config. It changes reward weights only and preserves dynamics, observations, task success thresholds, max steps, and task definitions.
- Added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_risk_nav_factorized_group_dagger_safe.yaml`, a conservative factorized-group PPO fine-tune config intended for DAgger BC checkpoints.

Reason:

- Under the new architecture, `goal_nav` is already repaired and `formation` is provisionally usable; `risk_nav` and `coverage` remain the blockers.
- Risk-nav failure is currently best explained by unsafe/collision-heavy successful demonstrations plus distribution mismatch. Low-collision-only filtering previously reduced state coverage and generalized worse.
- The next risk-nav repair attempt therefore uses learner-state DAgger plus conservative PPO rather than another strong hand-coded repulsion/reference branch.

## Theme AJ: risk_nav factorized_group DAgger BC result

Experiment:

- Collected learner-state DAgger data from phase38 factorized-group risk learner and relabeled with `HeuristicPolicy`.
- Dataset path: `outputs/debug_long/20260530_factorized_group_continuation/risk_nav_dagger_from_phase38_plus_success.npz`.
- Dataset includes original success data plus 6971 new learner-state samples, 8394 total samples.
- Trained BC with `configs/policy/debug_bc_risk_nav_factorized_group.yaml`.
- BC run: `outputs/training/bc/20260530_121227/debug_bc_risk_nav_factorized_group_risk_nav_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`.

Result:

- 30-episode BC eval: `success_rate_mean=0.533`, `collision_rate_mean=0.114`, `return_mean=-4.408`, `normalized_score_mean=0.659`.

Reasoning:

- This supports the hypothesis that risk-nav was not failing because the new architecture cannot represent useful actions; adding learner-state coverage improves success over the previous factorized-group risk plateau.
- Remaining blocker is safety/collision, so the follow-up PPO should be conservative and safety-shaped rather than high-entropy exploration.

## Theme AK: risk_nav factorized_group provisionally repaired

Experiment:

- PPO phase41 from the DAgger BC checkpoint using `configs/policy/debug_ppo_risk_nav_factorized_group_dagger_safe.yaml` and reward-only env config `configs/env/debug_risk_nav_safety_completion.yaml`.
- Run: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase41_risknav_factorized_group_dagger_safe/phase41_risknav_factorized_group_dagger_safe/`.
- Independent 100-episode eval: `outputs/debug_long/20260530_factorized_group_continuation/eval_phase41_risknav_100ep/risk_nav_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`.

Result:

- Best-source 30-episode final eval: `success_rate_mean=0.70`, `collision_rate_mean=0.017`.
- Independent 100-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.65`, `goal_coverage_ratio_mean=0.85`, `collision_rate_mean=0.0208`, `path_length_mean=0.699`.

Reasoning:

- DAgger fixed learner-state distribution mismatch; conservative PPO then improved safety/completion without overwriting BC behavior.
- Risk-nav should now be treated as provisionally repaired under the new `factorized_group` architecture, pending seed-repeat validation.

## Theme AL: coverage factorized_group h200 utility-slot PPO config

Implemented:

- Added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_completion_h200.yaml`.

Reason:

- Coverage under factorized-group is not mainly a collision/safety failure; it reaches reasonable coverage but misses the success threshold within the canonical 200-step budget.
- h300 success is diagnostic only, not a canonical fix.
- The new config stays on `factorized_group` and enables the existing coverage utility slot bias to improve spatial partitioning while using conservative PPO and reference regularization.

## Theme AM: coverage phase42 direct utility PPO failed

Experiment:

- Started `phase42_coverage_factorized_group_h200_utility` from the factorized-group coverage BC checkpoint using `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_completion_h200.yaml` and h200 completion reward config.

Result:

- Eval success was `0.0` at updates 20, 40, 60, and 80.
- The run was stopped early after update 90.

Reasoning:

- Directly enabling the coverage utility slot bias at PPO time changed the action prior too much and destroyed the BC behavior.
- Next coverage attempt should first train BC with the utility-enabled policy config, then PPO fine-tune from the adapted BC checkpoint.

## Theme AN: coverage utility-head BC adaptation configs

Implemented:

- Added `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_utility_perm.yaml`.
- Added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_utility_bcfit.yaml`.

Reason:

- phase42 showed that enabling a strong utility-slot bias only at PPO time destroys the BC action distribution.
- The adapted route lowers utility/repulsion strength and first trains BC with the same action prior, so PPO starts from a policy already fitted to the modified architecture.

## Theme AO: coverage utility-head BC failed

Experiment:

- Trained `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_utility_perm.yaml` on `outputs/debug_long/20260530_coverage_expert_v3/coverage_success_round4_plus_v3_e40.npz`.
- Run: `outputs/training/bc/20260530_135952/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_utility_perm_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`.

Result:

- BC loss reached about `0.002`.
- 30-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.0`, `collision_rate_mean=0.022`, `return_mean=5.010`.

Reasoning:

- This branch shows that supervised action fit is not enough for closed-loop coverage success when the utility prior changes the trajectory distribution.
- Do not PPO this checkpoint. Next coverage attempt should use learner-state DAgger with the original factorized-group policy first.

## Theme AP: coverage h200 teacher diagnostics

Diagnostics:

- Evaluated existing coverage teachers in canonical h200 env. Results saved to `outputs/debug_long/20260530_factorized_group_continuation/coverage_teacher_h200_eval.json`.
- `coverage_expert_v2` success `0.0`, coverage ratio `0.536`.
- `coverage_expert_v3` success `0.025`, coverage ratio `0.598`.
- `coverage_expert_v4` success `0.0`, coverage ratio `0.557`.
- `heuristic_greedy_coverage` success `0.0`, coverage ratio `0.456`.
- A temporary in-shell sweep prototype was tested and discarded because it had success `0.0`, coverage about `0.373`, and high collision.

Reasoning:

- Current coverage BC/DAgger data sources are not true h200 experts, so imitation alone is not expected to solve canonical h200 coverage.
- Added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_h200_stable.yaml` to run conservative PPO from the original factorized-group BC without utility-head changes.

## Theme AQ: coverage phase43 h200 stable PPO did not break through

Experiment:

- Ran `phase43_coverage_factorized_group_h200_stable` from the original factorized-group coverage BC checkpoint.
- Config: `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_h200_stable.yaml`.
- Env config: `configs/env/debug_coverage_completion_focus.yaml`.
- Run: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase43_coverage_factorized_group_h200_stable/phase43_coverage_factorized_group_h200_stable/`.

Result:

- Best periodic 30-episode eval: `success_rate=0.20` at update 60.
- Later evals stayed in `0.133-0.167`; run stopped early after update 120.

Reasoning:

- Stable PPO preserved but did not improve the original BC behavior.
- Coverage h200 remains unresolved under `factorized_group`.
- The blocker is now identified as missing high-success h200 supervision/curriculum, not direct architecture incompatibility or PPO math instability.

## Theme AR: coverage ratio-curriculum reward config

Implemented:

- Added `configs/env/debug_coverage_ratio_curriculum.yaml`.
- Added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_h200_ratio_curriculum.yaml`.

Reason:

- Coverage h200 policies are near but below threshold; teacher/DAgger and utility-head routes failed.
- This route changes reward weights only, preserving threshold, h200 budget, dynamics, and task definition.
- It increases dense coverage-level and terminal shortfall/failure pressure so PPO has stronger gradient near the success threshold.

## Theme AS: coverage phase44 ratio-curriculum failed

Experiment:

- Ran `phase44_coverage_factorized_group_ratio_curriculum` using reward-only config `configs/env/debug_coverage_ratio_curriculum.yaml` and PPO config `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_h200_ratio_curriculum.yaml`.
- Run: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase44_coverage_factorized_group_ratio_curriculum/phase44_coverage_factorized_group_ratio_curriculum/`.

Result:

- Best periodic 30-episode eval: `success_rate=0.1667` at update 20.
- Update 100 eval: `success_rate=0.1667`, `coverage_ratio=0.696`, `collision_rate=0.0090`.

Reasoning:

- Stronger dense coverage-ratio reward did not exceed the original BC baseline and made value fitting noisier.
- Coverage h200 remains unresolved. Current evidence points to missing high-success h200 trajectory/curriculum signal rather than PPO math or the factorized-group architecture alone.

## Theme AT: coverage optional milestone reward

Implemented:

- `tasks/coverage.py` now supports optional one-time coverage milestone bonuses configured by `reward_weights.coverage.milestone_thresholds` and `milestone_bonuses`.
- Added `configs/env/debug_coverage_milestone_reward.yaml`.
- Added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_h200_milestone.yaml`.
- Added `test_coverage_milestone_reward_pays_once` in `tests/test_rewards_basic.py`.

Reason:

- Coverage h200 is stuck near-but-below the canonical success threshold. Existing dense ratio shaping did not provide useful PPO improvement.
- Milestones provide clearer intermediate credit without changing success criteria, max steps, dynamics, observations, or task definition.

Verification:

- `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_rewards_basic.py tests/test_variable_policies.py`
- Result: `22 passed`.

## Theme AU: coverage phase45 milestone PPO did not transfer to canonical task

Experiment:

- Ran `phase45_coverage_factorized_group_milestone` with optional milestone reward.
- Run: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase45_coverage_factorized_group_milestone/phase45_coverage_factorized_group_milestone/`.
- Canonical 100-episode eval: `outputs/debug_long/20260530_factorized_group_continuation/eval_phase45_coverage_canonical_100ep/coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`.

Result:

- Milestone-env best-source 30-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.233`, `collision_rate_mean=0.0`.
- Canonical h200 100-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.17`, `coverage_ratio_mean=0.715`, `collision_rate_mean=0.00236`, `repeated_coverage_ratio_mean=0.991`.

Reasoning:

- Milestone reward did not transfer to the canonical task. Coverage remains unresolved.
- Very high repeated coverage ratio shows the remaining failure mode is inefficient revisit/poor spatial allocation, not safety or action saturation.

## Theme AV: coverage terminal anti-revisit reward

Implemented:

- `tasks/coverage.py` now supports optional `reward_weights.coverage.terminal_repeated_coverage`.
- Added `configs/env/debug_coverage_antirevisit_reward.yaml`.
- Added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_h200_antirevisit.yaml`.
- Added `test_coverage_terminal_repeated_penalty_only_on_timeout`.

Reason:

- Phase45 canonical eval showed `repeated_coverage_ratio_mean=0.991`; the dominant failure mode is repeated revisiting, not collision.
- The new reward term penalizes final repeated coverage at timeout without changing success threshold, max steps, dynamics, or observations.

Verification:

- `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_rewards_basic.py tests/test_variable_policies.py`
- Result: `23 passed`.

## Theme AW: coverage phase46 anti-revisit PPO did not transfer

Experiment:

- Ran `phase46_coverage_factorized_group_antirevisit` with optional terminal anti-revisit reward.
- Run: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase46_coverage_factorized_group_antirevisit/phase46_coverage_factorized_group_antirevisit/`.
- Canonical 100-episode eval: `outputs/debug_long/20260530_factorized_group_continuation/eval_phase46_coverage_canonical_100ep/coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`.

Result:

- Anti-revisit training config best-source 30-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.267`, `collision_rate_mean=0.0`.
- Canonical h200 100-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.20`, `coverage_ratio_mean=0.733`, `collision_rate_mean=0.00228`, `repeated_coverage_ratio_mean=0.99125`.

Reasoning:

- The reward term did not reduce repeated coverage under canonical validation. Coverage h200 remains unresolved.
- The remaining issue requires persistent frontier assignment or a stronger h200 teacher/curriculum, not more scalar reward-only tweaks of the same form.

## Theme AX: coverage canonical success-only dataset from phase46

Experiment:

- Collected successful canonical h200 coverage trajectories from phase46 best checkpoint.
- Dataset: `outputs/debug_long/20260530_factorized_group_continuation/coverage_success_from_phase46_canonical_plus_v3.npz`.
- Summary: `outputs/debug_long/20260530_factorized_group_continuation/coverage_success_from_phase46_canonical_plus_v3.summary.json`.

Result:

- 30 successful episodes from 142 attempts, success rate over attempts `0.2113`.
- 22643 total samples including base dataset.
- Mean success collision rate `0.0`, mean success path length `1.072`.

Reasoning:

- These are actual canonical h200 successes from the new architecture, so they are a better BC target than weak coverage heuristic teachers.

## Theme AY: coverage success-heavy BC failed

Experiment:

- Trained original factorized-group BC config on `outputs/debug_long/20260530_factorized_group_continuation/coverage_success_from_phase46_canonical_plus_v3.npz`.
- Run: `outputs/training/bc/20260530_163520/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_perm_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`.

Result:

- Canonical 50-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.140`, `collision_rate_mean=0.0`, `return_mean=9.522`.

Reasoning:

- Rare success trajectory cloning overfits and lowers closed-loop robustness. Coverage remains unresolved.
- The next credible route is persistent frontier/group target assignment or a true high-success h200 teacher, not more BC/PPO from current weak data.

## Theme AZ: post-continuation regression test

Verification:

- Ran `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_rewards_basic.py tests/test_variable_policies.py tests/test_bc_permutation_loss.py tests/test_expert_dataset.py tests/test_ppo_episode_budget.py`.
- Result: `26 passed`.

Current task status under factorized_group after this continuation:

- `goal_nav`: repaired from earlier phase36 evidence, 50-episode best eval `success_rate_mean=0.78`.
- `risk_nav`: provisionally repaired in this continuation. Phase41 canonical/safety 100-episode eval `success_rate_mean=0.65`, `collision_rate_mean=0.0208`.
- `formation`: provisionally repaired from earlier phase39 evidence, 50-episode best eval `success_rate_mean=0.44`, near-zero collision.
- `coverage`: still unresolved under canonical h200. Best reliable canonical 100-episode result remains about `success_rate_mean=0.20`, coverage ratio about `0.733`; repeated coverage remains about `0.991`.

## Theme BA: coverage frontier-slot policy for factorized_group

Implemented:

- Added optional `use_coverage_frontier_slot_head` to `policies/cnn_deepsets_policy.py`.
- Wired the same frontier slot bias into `policies/factorized_group_policy.py`.
- Added tests for CNNDeepSets and factorized-group frontier slot compatibility.
- Added configs:
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_frontier_perm.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_frontier.yaml`

Reason:

- Coverage canonical h200 remained stuck around `0.20` success with repeated coverage ratio around `0.991`.
- Reward-only tweaks and weak-teacher BC did not reduce repeated coverage.
- The new frontier slot explicitly assigns agents to remaining unvisited demand using stable sectors and suppression, while preserving centralized critic and per-agent actor output shape.

Verification:

- `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_variable_policies.py tests/test_rewards_basic.py`
- Result: `25 passed`.

## Theme BB: coverage frontier-slot BC from scratch failed

Experiment:

- Trained `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_frontier_perm.yaml` from scratch on phase46 success-heavy dataset.
- Run: `outputs/training/bc/20260531_015126/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_frontier_perm_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`.

Result:

- Canonical 50-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.10`, `collision_rate_mean=0.004`, `return_mean=8.239`.

Reasoning:

- Supervised loss is low but closed-loop behavior degraded. Warm-start from the original coverage BC checkpoint is the next safer route.

## Theme BC: coverage frontier-slot warm-start BC still below baseline

Experiment:

- Warm-started frontier BC from the original coverage BC checkpoint.
- Run: `outputs/training/bc/20260531_015932/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_frontier_perm_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`.

Result:

- Canonical 50-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.16`, `collision_rate_mean=0.003`, `return_mean=8.434`.

Reasoning:

- Warm-start helped compared with frontier BC from scratch but did not beat the original baseline. Next attempt is conservative PPO from this checkpoint.

## Theme BD: coverage phase47 frontier PPO failed

Experiment:

- Ran `phase47_coverage_factorized_group_frontier` from warm-start frontier BC.
- Run: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260531_phase47_coverage_factorized_group_frontier/phase47_coverage_factorized_group_frontier/`.

Result:

- Best/final-source 30-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.167`, `collision_rate_mean=0.012`.

Reasoning:

- Frontier strength `0.22` remains too disruptive. Next attempt should use lower frontier strength and original BC checkpoint.

## Theme BE: low-strength coverage frontier PPO config

Implemented:

- Added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_frontier_low.yaml`.

Reason:

- Phase47 showed frontier strength `0.22` is too disruptive.
- The low-strength config uses frontier strength `0.08`, stronger reference regularization, lower target KL, and starts directly from the original coverage BC checkpoint.

## Theme BF: low-strength coverage frontier PPO failed

Experiment:

- Ran `phase48_coverage_factorized_group_frontier_low` from the original coverage BC checkpoint.
- Run: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260531_phase48_coverage_factorized_group_frontier_low/phase48_coverage_factorized_group_frontier_low/`.

Result:

- Update 20 success `0.033`, update 40 success `0.033`, update 60 success `0.067`.
- Stopped early after update 70.

Reasoning:

- Even low-strength immediate frontier bias damages the existing closed-loop coverage behavior. Do not continue this branch as-is.

## Theme BG: coverage h200 teacher prototypes failed

Diagnostics:

- Tested an in-shell one-step local greedy coverage teacher: success `0.0`, coverage `≈0.379`, collision `0.0`.
- Tested an in-shell waypoint-lookahead greedy coverage teacher: success `0.05`, coverage `≈0.608`, collision `≈0.0217`.

Reasoning:

- Simple greedy h200 teacher generation is insufficient. A useful coverage teacher likely needs explicit route planning/sweeping, not local scoring.
- No official teacher code was added for these failed prototypes.

## Theme BH: frontier continuation regression test

Verification:

- Ran `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_variable_policies.py tests/test_rewards_basic.py tests/test_bc_permutation_loss.py tests/test_expert_dataset.py tests/test_ppo_episode_budget.py`.
- Result: `28 passed`.
- No training/evaluation process remained running after phase48 and teacher prototype diagnostics.

## Theme BI: specialist PPO reliability documentation

Implemented:

- Added `docs/specialist_ppo_reliability_zh.md`.

Content:

- Explains why pure PPO is unreliable for this benchmark: sparse success, high-dimensional joint continuous actions, long horizon, multi-objective reward conflict, credit assignment, and on-policy drift.
- Records why BC/DAgger warm-start is currently necessary rather than cosmetic.
- Summarizes current per-task training recipes and status under `factorized_group`.
- Documents why coverage remains unresolved and why the next route should be h200 route-planning/sweep teacher or stateful persistent target memory.

Reason:

- The user asked to preserve the recent analysis in both memory and docs so future agents can reuse the rationale instead of repeating failed PPO-only or reward-only attempts.

## Theme BJ: coverage training curriculum v1

Implemented:

- `tasks/coverage.py` now supports optional `coverage.demand_quantile`; default remains `0.55`.
- Added `configs/env/debug_coverage_train_curriculum_v1.yaml` with coverage-specific training environment/reward curriculum.
- Added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_train_curriculum_v1.yaml`.
- Added `test_coverage_demand_quantile_controls_demand_area`.

Reason:

- User now allows coverage-specific training environment and reward design changes.
- Canonical h200 coverage has not converged with reward-only scalar tweaks or frontier bias.
- Curriculum v1 narrows demand area, extends training horizon to 260, and strengthens completion/anti-repeat reward to bootstrap successful behavior.

Verification:

- `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_rewards_basic.py tests/test_variable_policies.py`
- Result: `26 passed`.

## Theme BK: coverage phase49 curriculum v1 converged in modified training env

Experiment:

- Ran `phase49_coverage_train_curriculum_v1` from original factorized-group coverage BC checkpoint.
- Run: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260531_phase49_coverage_train_curriculum_v1/phase49_coverage_train_curriculum_v1/`.

Result:

- Training-env success rose from `0.60` at update 20 to `0.733` at update 60/160.
- Independent training-env 100-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.73`, `coverage_ratio_mean=0.742`, `return_mean=116.729`.
- Canonical 100-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.14`, `coverage_ratio_mean=0.712`.

Reasoning:

- Coverage PPO can converge when the coverage-specific training env is made curriculum-friendly.
- This is not yet a canonical repair; it should be used as a curriculum stage before a closer-to-canonical bridge.

## Theme BL: coverage curriculum v2 bridge config

Implemented:

- Added `configs/env/debug_coverage_train_curriculum_v2_bridge.yaml`.
- Added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_train_curriculum_v2_bridge.yaml`.

Reason:

- Phase49 converged in the easier curriculum env but did not transfer to canonical.
- V2 bridge moves closer to canonical by using demand quantile `0.60`, success ratio `0.80`, and max steps `240`.

## Theme BM: coverage phase50 bridge curriculum result

Experiment:

- Ran `phase50_coverage_train_curriculum_v2_bridge` from phase49 best checkpoint.
- Run: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260531_phase50_coverage_train_curriculum_v2_bridge/phase50_coverage_train_curriculum_v2_bridge/`.

Result:

- Bridge 100-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.56`, `coverage_ratio_mean=0.744`, `return_mean=59.100`, `collision_rate_mean=0.00323`.
- Canonical 100-episode eval: `success_rate_mean=0.13`, `coverage_ratio_mean=0.716`, `return_mean=9.777`.

Reasoning:

- Modified coverage training env can produce rising reward/success, but transfer to canonical h200 remains weak.
- As the curriculum approaches canonical, success falls, confirming that canonical coverage still needs stronger environment/reward redesign or route-planning supervision.

## Theme BN: coverage curriculum regression test

Verification:

- Ran `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_rewards_basic.py tests/test_variable_policies.py tests/test_bc_permutation_loss.py tests/test_expert_dataset.py tests/test_ppo_episode_budget.py`.
- Result: `29 passed`.
- No active training/evaluation process remained after phase50 and evaluations.

## Theme BO: coverage anti-repeat reward and sequential group actor

Implemented:

- `tasks/coverage.py` now exposes two optional anti-revisit reward terms:
  - `reward_weights.coverage.repeated_demand_coverage`: per-step penalty for covering already-fulfilled demand cells, normalized by demand area.
  - `reward_weights.coverage.terminal_revisit_excess`: terminal penalty for cumulative excess demand visits, reported by new metric `demand_revisit_excess`.
- `policies/factorized_group_policy.py` now supports optional sequential group conditioning:
  - `use_sequential_group_context: true`
  - `sequential_group_context_strength`
  - Later group tokens are conditioned on previous group target coordinates, so group decisions are no longer independent when this option is enabled.
- Fixed policy factory propagation for `coverage_frontier_*` options. Before this fix, frontier-slot configs constructed a valid policy but did not actually enable the frontier head.
- Added `configs/env/debug_coverage_train_curriculum_v3_antirepeat.yaml`.
- Added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_seq_frontier_antirepeat.yaml`.
- Added tests for configurable demand revisit penalties and sequential group context.

Reasoning:

- Previous canonical/bridge coverage runs had `repeated_coverage_ratio≈0.99`, so policies learned to sit in or revisit already covered areas while still receiving partial coverage reward.
- The new per-step demand revisit term gives dense negative feedback exactly when a policy wastes coverage radius on already-fulfilled demand cells.
- The new terminal revisit-excess term separates “same final coverage with efficient sweep” from “same final coverage after excessive revisits”.
- Sequential group conditioning implements the user-requested grouped decision mode where later group decisions can see earlier group outputs while preserving centralized critic, shared per-agent decoder, `[B, N, 2]` output, `agent_mask`, and variable-N support.
- The frontier factory fix means future frontier experiments are now real; earlier frontier phase47/48 results should be interpreted cautiously because the config knobs were not actually wired through.

Verification:

- `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_rewards_basic.py tests/test_variable_policies.py tests/test_policy_action_distribution.py`
- Result: `31 passed`.
- Checkpoint compatibility probe from phase50 best into the new sequential policy succeeded with only the 4 new sequential projection parameters missing.
- 2-update PPO smoke:
  - Run: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260601_phase51_smoke/phase51_smoke_seq_frontier_antirepeat/`
  - Init: phase50 best checkpoint.
  - Result: training/eval path completed; 2-episode eval `success_rate=0.50`, `collision_rate=0.0`, return negative because anti-repeat penalties are intentionally much stronger.

Long experiment launched:

- Phase51 run command started with `setsid`.
- PID file: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase51_coverage_seq_frontier_antirepeat/train.pid`.
- Log file: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase51_coverage_seq_frontier_antirepeat/train.log`.
- Expected run dir: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260601_phase51_coverage_seq_frontier_antirepeat/phase51_coverage_seq_frontier_antirepeat/`.
- Init checkpoint: phase50 bridge best.
- Configs:
  - `configs/env/debug_coverage_train_curriculum_v3_antirepeat.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_seq_frontier_antirepeat.yaml`

Phase51 early stop:

- Stopped at update 45 after update 40 eval showed no recovery.
- Update 20 eval: `success_rate=0.133`, `coverage_ratio=0.696479`, `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.991442`, `demand_revisit_excess=31.645258`.
- Update 40 eval: `success_rate=0.133`, `coverage_ratio=0.696357`, `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.991393`, `demand_revisit_excess=31.673179`.
- Interpretation: turning on real frontier bias plus new sequential parameters plus very large terminal revisit-excess penalty perturbed the phase50 checkpoint too much and did not reduce repeated coverage.

Implemented phase52:

- Added `configs/env/debug_coverage_train_curriculum_v3_moderate_antirepeat.yaml`.
- Added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_seq_moderate_antirepeat.yaml`.
- Differences from phase51:
  - frontier slot disabled to preserve the phase50 behavior distribution;
  - sequential group context kept but weakened to `0.15`;
  - anti-repeat reward remains active but terminal dominance is reduced:
    - `repeated_coverage=-0.35`
    - `repeated_demand_coverage=-2.0`
    - `terminal_repeated_coverage=-18.0`
    - `terminal_revisit_excess=-3.0`
- Reason: phase51 proved that huge terminal penalties create value noise and do not teach mid-episode retargeting. Phase52 tests whether weak sequential conditioning plus moderate dense revisit cost can improve without destroying the phase50 bridge policy.

Phase52 launched:

- PID file: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase52_coverage_seq_moderate_antirepeat/train.pid`.
- Log file: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase52_coverage_seq_moderate_antirepeat/train.log`.
- Expected run dir: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260601_phase52_coverage_seq_moderate_antirepeat/phase52_coverage_seq_moderate_antirepeat/`.

Phase52 early stop and control eval:

- Phase52 was stopped after update 20 because eval stayed poor:
  - `success_rate=0.1667`
  - `coverage_ratio=0.718132`
  - `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.991589`
  - `demand_revisit_excess=29.152401`
- Control eval of the unchanged phase50 policy on the same `v3_moderate_antirepeat` env:
  - CSV: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase52_coverage_seq_moderate_antirepeat/eval_phase50_on_v3_moderate_30ep/coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`
  - `success_rate=0.50`
  - `coverage_ratio=0.747009`
  - `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.991306`
  - `demand_revisit_excess=28.143183`
  - `return=-64.43454`
- Interpretation: the moderate anti-repeat environment itself preserves phase50 behavior; the weak sequential group context still perturbs the checkpoint enough to damage success.

Implemented phase53:

- Added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_moderate_antirepeat.yaml`.
- This keeps the original factorized-group architecture from phase50 and trains only under the moderate anti-repeat reward.
- Reason: first establish whether the reward change can improve phase50 without architecture perturbation. If yes, sequential group context should be added later via BC/refit or a gated zero-init path, not by direct PPO warm-start with random new parameters.

Phase53 launched:

- PID file: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase53_coverage_moderate_antirepeat/train.pid`.
- Log file: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase53_coverage_moderate_antirepeat/train.log`.
- Expected run dir: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260601_phase53_coverage_moderate_antirepeat/phase53_coverage_moderate_antirepeat/`.

Phase53 early stop:

- Stopped after update 40 eval failed to recover to the phase50 control.
- Update 20: `success_rate=0.3667`, `coverage_ratio=0.738746`, `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.990699`, `demand_revisit_excess=28.518539`.
- Update 40: `success_rate=0.3667`, `coverage_ratio=0.729345`, `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.990817`, `demand_revisit_excess=28.495747`.
- Interpretation: moderate anti-repeat PPO without architecture changes is less damaging than phase51/52 but still drifts below the phase50 control (`success=0.50`) and does not reduce revisit metrics enough.

Implemented phase54:

- Added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_moderate_antirepeat_safe.yaml`.
- Same architecture and env as phase53, but more conservative PPO:
  - `learning_rate=2e-6`
  - `reference_policy_coef=1.0`
  - `clip_coef=0.01`
  - `target_kl=0.0008`
  - `max_grad_norm=0.35`
  - `log_std_max=-1.25`
- Reason: phase53 shows PPO is moving the policy out of the success basin faster than anti-repeat reward can improve routing. Phase54 tests whether tighter behavior regularization can preserve phase50 success while allowing slow reward adaptation.

Phase54 launched:

- PID file: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase54_coverage_moderate_antirepeat_safe/train.pid`.
- Log file: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase54_coverage_moderate_antirepeat_safe/train.log`.
- Expected run dir: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260601_phase54_coverage_moderate_antirepeat_safe/phase54_coverage_moderate_antirepeat_safe/`.

Phase54 interim result:

- Update 20: `success_rate=0.4667`, `coverage_ratio=0.745157`, `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.990504`, `demand_revisit_excess=27.586895`, `return=-75.093002`.
- Update 40: `success_rate=0.5000`, `coverage_ratio=0.746011`, `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.990377`, `demand_revisit_excess=27.777411`, `return=-64.570771`.
- Update 60: `success_rate=0.5333`, `coverage_ratio=0.743630`, `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.990713`, `demand_revisit_excess=27.829508`, `return=-53.686137`.
- Interpretation:
  - Conservative PPO finally preserves and slightly improves phase50 bridge success (`0.50 -> 0.5333`).
  - Return improves under the anti-repeat reward.
  - Revisit metrics are only slightly better than the phase50 control (`demand_revisit_excess≈28.14`) and remain high, so this is not a complete coverage fix yet.
  - Continue phase54 to completion, then run independent 100-episode eval on `v3_moderate_antirepeat` and canonical `configs/env/coverage.yaml`.

Phase54 stopped and independently evaluated:

- Stopped after update 100 drifted down (`success_rate=0.4333`) from the best update 60.
- Best checkpoint remained update 60:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260601_phase54_coverage_moderate_antirepeat_safe/phase54_coverage_moderate_antirepeat_safe/checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt`
- Independent v3 moderate 100-episode eval:
  - CSV: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase54_coverage_moderate_antirepeat_safe/eval_phase54_best_v3_moderate_100ep/coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`
  - `success_rate=0.56`
  - `coverage_ratio=0.745690`
  - `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.990990`
  - `demand_revisit_excess=27.358407`
  - `return=-44.033868`
  - `collision_rate=0.003417`
  - `path_length=1.166319`
- Phase50 control on the same v3 moderate env was:
  - `success_rate=0.50`
  - `coverage_ratio=0.747009`
  - `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.991306`
  - `demand_revisit_excess=28.143183`
  - `return=-64.434540`
- Independent canonical 100-episode eval:
  - CSV: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase54_coverage_moderate_antirepeat_safe/eval_phase54_best_canonical_100ep/coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`
  - `success_rate=0.12`
  - `coverage_ratio=0.711085`
  - `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.991357`
  - `demand_revisit_excess=25.194444`
  - `return=9.568191`
  - `collision_rate=0.002713`
  - `path_length=1.099539`
- Phase50 canonical transfer was `success_rate=0.13`, `coverage_ratio=0.716001`, so phase54 improves the modified training env but does not improve canonical transfer.

Conclusion:

- The safe anti-repeat PPO recipe is the best modified-env continuation so far for coverage (`v3_moderate` 100-episode success `0.56`).
- It is not a canonical repair. Canonical h200 remains around `0.12-0.13` success.
- Sequential group context cannot be introduced by direct PPO warm-start with random new parameters; it needs BC/refit or a zero-impact/gated initialization before PPO.

Implemented phase55:

- Added `configs/env/debug_coverage_train_curriculum_v4_canonical_bridge.yaml`.
- Added `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_canonical_bridge_safe.yaml`.
- Purpose: continue from phase54 best toward canonical coverage:
  - `max_steps=220`
  - `success_ratio=0.81`
  - `demand_quantile=0.55`
  - moderate anti-repeat rewards retained but weaker than v3
  - same conservative PPO settings as phase54.
- Verification:
  - `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_rewards_basic.py tests/test_variable_policies.py tests/test_policy_action_distribution.py`
  - Result: `31 passed`.

Phase55 launched:

- PID file: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase55_coverage_canonical_bridge_safe/train.pid`.
- Log file: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase55_coverage_canonical_bridge_safe/train.log`.
- Expected run dir: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260601_phase55_coverage_canonical_bridge_safe/phase55_coverage_canonical_bridge_safe/`.
- Init checkpoint: phase54 best.

Phase55 result:

- Run completed:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260601_phase55_coverage_canonical_bridge_safe/phase55_coverage_canonical_bridge_safe/`
- Best checkpoint:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260601_phase55_coverage_canonical_bridge_safe/phase55_coverage_canonical_bridge_safe/checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt`
  - best update `100`
- Best/final 30-episode bridge eval:
  - `success_rate=0.30`
  - `coverage_ratio=0.725249`
  - `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.991341`
  - `demand_revisit_excess=27.166739`
  - `return=-99.392137`
  - `collision_rate=0.002576`
- Interpretation:
  - Phase55 is not an improvement over phase54's v3-moderate 100-episode result (`success_rate=0.56`).
  - It does show partial bridge transfer above canonical (`0.30` vs canonical `0.12`), but the closer-to-canonical demand/horizon still breaks most successful completion behavior.
  - Revisit metrics remain high. The remaining issue is not just scalar reward weight; the policy lacks a robust route/sweep behavior under wider demand.

Next implication:

- Stop pure PPO continuation as the main coverage path.
- Move to data-side repair: collect successful and preferably lower-revisit trajectories from phase54/phase55 environments, then BC/refit before any further PPO.

Phase56 data-side repair attempt:

- Enhanced `scripts/debug_long/collect_success_policy_dataset.py`:
  - added `--max_demand_revisit_excess`
  - added `--max_repeated_coverage_ratio`
  - summary now records mean successful `repeated_coverage_ratio` and `demand_revisit_excess`.
- Collected phase54 v3-moderate low-revisit success data:
  - dataset: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase56_coverage_low_revisit_data/phase54_v3_success_lowrevisit.npz`
  - summary: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase56_coverage_low_revisit_data/phase54_v3_success_lowrevisit.summary.json`
  - `30` successful episodes from `140` attempts
  - `4848` samples
  - mean successful `demand_revisit_excess=27.160990`
  - mean successful `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.990324`
  - mean successful collision `0.0000406`
- Collected phase55 v4-bridge low-revisit success data:
  - dataset: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase56_coverage_low_revisit_data/phase55_v4_success_lowrevisit.npz`
  - summary: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase56_coverage_low_revisit_data/phase55_v4_success_lowrevisit.summary.json`
  - `20` successful episodes from `112` attempts
  - `3453` samples
  - mean successful `demand_revisit_excess=25.644311`
  - mean successful `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.990960`
  - mean successful collision `0.000100`
- Merged data:
  - dataset: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase56_coverage_low_revisit_data/coverage_phase54_phase55_lowrevisit_success_merged.npz`
  - `8301` samples.
- Warm-start BC/refit:
  - init checkpoint: phase54 best
  - config: `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_perm.yaml`
  - dataset: merged low-revisit success data above
  - run: `outputs/training/bc/20260601_021316/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_perm_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`
  - v4 bridge final eval: `success_rate=0.30`, `coverage_ratio=0.725430`, `demand_revisit_excess=27.419515`, `return=-100.167997`.

Conclusion:

- Low-revisit success-only BC from current policy did not improve over phase55.
- It mostly reproduces the same partial bridge behavior.
- Next coverage route needs a stronger teacher/route-planning data source rather than more current-policy success filtering.

Phase57 sweep teacher diagnostic:

- Added `CoverageExpertV5` in `scripts/debug_long/generate_coverage_expert_v2_dataset.py`.
- V5 is a diagnostic stateful lawnmower/stripe-sweep teacher:
  - partitions demand cells into x-stripes;
  - assigns one persistent route per agent;
  - follows the route until local demand is fulfilled;
  - includes simple repulsion for collision avoidance.
- 50-episode diagnostic rollout:
  - v4 bridge env:
    - `success=0.82`
    - `coverage_ratio=0.802366`
    - `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.985556`
    - `demand_revisit_excess=23.714672`
    - `collision_rate=0.0`
    - `path_length=0.876563`
  - canonical env:
    - `success=0.66`
    - `coverage_ratio=0.804135`
    - `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.985571`
    - `demand_revisit_excess=23.708844`
    - `collision_rate=0.0`
    - `path_length=0.880012`
- Generated formal V5 datasets:
  - bridge: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase57_coverage_sweep_teacher/v5_bridge_e100.npz`
    - terminal success `0.80`
    - `17160` samples
  - canonical: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase57_coverage_sweep_teacher/v5_canonical_e100.npz`
    - terminal success `0.63`
    - `16979` samples
  - merged: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase57_coverage_sweep_teacher/v5_bridge_canonical_e200_merged.npz`
    - `34139` samples
    - terminal success `0.715`
- BC on V5 merged data:
  - init: phase54 best
  - config: `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_perm.yaml`
  - run: `outputs/training/bc/20260601_022614/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_perm_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`
  - canonical 50-episode final eval:
    - `success_rate=0.30`
    - `coverage_ratio=0.758937`
    - `demand_revisit_excess=23.682952`
    - `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.991763`
    - `collision_rate=0.0`
    - `return=13.441922`

Interpretation:

- V5 proves that persistent route/sweep behavior solves much of coverage: teacher canonical success `0.66`.
- Plain factorized-group BC does not fully inherit this behavior because the actor is memoryless; it sees visited map but does not maintain a route pointer or persistent assigned target.
- Static BC improves coverage ratio and demand revisit excess, but not success enough.
- Next implementation should put persistence into the policy/decision mechanism, not only into the teacher.

Phase58 stateless lawnmower route-head attempt:

- Implemented optional policy route bias:
  - `use_coverage_lawnmower_route_head`
  - `coverage_lawnmower_route_strength`
  - `coverage_lawnmower_*` weights
- Added factory wiring in `policies/__init__.py`.
- Added factorized-group forward support.
- Added tests for factorized-group lawnmower route head.
- Added configs:
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_lawnmower_perm.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_lawnmower_safe.yaml`
- Verification:
  - `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_variable_policies.py tests/test_policy_action_distribution.py`
  - Result: `22 passed`.

Diagnostic results:

- Direct phase54 best checkpoint evaluated with route-head config on canonical:

  - `success_rate=0.0333`

  - `collision_rate=0.014792`
- Route-head BC run was interrupted/ended after epoch 4:
  - run: `outputs/training/bc/20260601_025152/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_lawnmower_perm_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`
  - epoch4 checkpoint canonical eval:
    - CSV: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase58_lawnmower_head_eval/eval_lawnmower_bc_epoch4_canonical_30ep/coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`
    - `success_rate=0.1333`
    - `coverage_ratio=0.719913`
    - `demand_revisit_excess=24.180358`
    - `collision_rate=0.009542`
- For comparison, V5 BC without route head was better:
  - `success_rate=0.30`
  - `coverage_ratio=0.758937`
  - `demand_revisit_excess=23.682952`
  - collision `0`.

Interpretation:

- The stateless route-head is not a valid replacement for V5 persistence.
- It recomputes stripe targets each step and can conflict with the learned residual actor, causing collisions and lower success.
- Do not continue this exact lawnmower-head config.
- The strong result remains the V5 teacher itself; if using it for learning, the model needs genuine temporal persistence/recurrent state or route pointer information, not just a per-step deterministic bias.

Phase59 route-hint observation implementation:

- Stopped the still-running phase58 route-head BC process because phase58 was already empirically worse than V5 BC and should not consume more compute.
- Added optional coverage env/task persistence without changing observation shape:
  - `coverage.route_hint_enabled`
  - `coverage.route_hint_stride`
  - `coverage.route_hint_sigma`
  - `coverage.route_hint_value_quantile`
- Implementation location:
  - `tasks/coverage.py`
- Design:
  - CoverageTask now maintains persistent per-agent stripe/lawnmower routes in `task_state`.
  - The current route target map is exposed through the existing `formation_template` channel only when `coverage.route_hint_enabled=true`.
  - This avoids changing `CHANNEL_NAMES` / task field shape, so old CNN checkpoints remain loadable.
  - Persistence is in env/task state, not in `policy.forward()`, so PPO minibatch logprob recomputation remains valid.
- Added optional policy-side route-hint bias:
  - `use_coverage_route_hint_head`
  - `coverage_route_hint_strength`
  - `coverage_route_hint_temperature`
  - `coverage_route_hint_distance_weight`
- Implementation location:
  - `policies/cnn_deepsets_policy.py`
  - `policies/factorized_group_policy.py`
  - `policies/__init__.py`
- Added phase59 configs:
  - `configs/env/debug_coverage_route_hint_canonical.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_route_hint_perm.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_route_hint_safe.yaml`
- Rationale:
  - V5 teacher succeeded because it has persistent route memory.
  - Stateless route-head failed because it recomputed targets every step and fought the learned residual actor.
  - Route-hint observation makes persistence part of the Markov observation instead of hidden policy state, which is the safe path for PPO.

Phase59 direct route-hint checkpoint diagnostics:

- Evaluated phase54 best checkpoint with route-hint env/policy:
  - CSV: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase59_coverage_route_hint/eval_phase54_route_hint_50ep/coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`
  - `success_rate=0.0`
  - `coverage_ratio=0.531557`
  - `collision_rate=0.008700`
  - `path_length=1.096755`
  - `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.988878`
  - `demand_revisit_excess=24.384818`
  - `return=-219.611562`
- Evaluated V5-BC checkpoint with route-hint env/policy before sequential suppression:
  - CSV: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase59_coverage_route_hint/eval_v5bc_route_hint_50ep/coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`
  - `success_rate=0.0`
  - `coverage_ratio=0.594574`
  - `collision_rate=0.014675`
  - `path_length=1.078980`
  - `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.988729`
  - `demand_revisit_excess=26.474563`
  - `return=-213.821676`
- Added route-hint sequential suppression in the policy head:
  - `coverage_route_hint_suppression_strength`
  - `coverage_route_hint_suppression_sigma`
  - intent: later agents should avoid already selected route-hint peaks, approximating sequential group assignment while keeping `forward()` stateless and replay-safe.
- Tests:
  - `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_task_fields.py tests/test_variable_policies.py tests/test_policy_action_distribution.py`
  - Result: `29 passed`.
- Evaluated V5-BC checkpoint with suppression:
  - CSV: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase59_coverage_route_hint/eval_v5bc_route_hint_suppression_30ep/coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`
  - `success_rate=0.0`
  - `coverage_ratio=0.615120`
  - `collision_rate=0.013708`
  - `path_length=1.099243`
  - `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.990041`
  - `demand_revisit_excess=27.814795`
  - `return=-213.428082`
- Interpretation:
  - Directly adding route-hint bias to old checkpoints is not viable.
  - The CNN/actor was not trained with this channel and the route-hint map alone lacks a supervised association to the residual behavior.
  - Continue with route-hint-aware V5 data generation and BC, not more direct checkpoint+bias evaluation.

Phase59 route-hint BC data:

- Generated V5 teacher data under route-hint env:
  - dataset: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase59_coverage_route_hint/v5_route_hint_canonical_e120.npz`
  - samples: `20210`
  - episodes: `120`
  - terminal success: `0.641667`
  - route-hint channel nonzero fraction: `1.0`
- First BC attempt failed before training due route-hint suppression OOM:
  - reason: suppression built a full 64x64 token pair matrix for batch 256, requiring about 32GB CUDA memory.
- Fix:
  - added `coverage_route_hint_pool_size` with default `16`.
  - route-hint head now adaptive-max-pools the hint channel before sequential suppression, matching the existing utility/frontier head pattern.

Phase59 route-hint BC result:

- Route-hint-head BC completed:
  - run: `outputs/training/bc/20260601_032154/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_route_hint_perm_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`
  - dataset: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase59_coverage_route_hint/v5_route_hint_canonical_e120.npz`
  - env: `configs/env/debug_coverage_route_hint_canonical.yaml`
  - final eval: `success_rate=0.26`, `coverage_ratio=0.744232`, `collision_rate=0.006125`, `path_length=1.077288`, `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.990756`, `demand_revisit_excess=25.625035`, `return=-103.843146`.
- Interpretation:
  - This is not better than V5 BC without route head (`success_rate=0.30`).
  - The route-hint action bias still interferes with the learned residual actor.
  - Next attempt should keep the route-hint channel in observation but disable the explicit route-hint action head, so the CNN can learn whether/how to use the channel.
- Added:
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_route_hint_obs_perm.yaml`

Phase60 per-agent route-target observation implementation:

- Added optional agent observation extension:
  - config key: `include_route_targets_in_agents`
  - location: `envs/centralized_env.py`
  - default: `false`, so old configs/checkpoints keep the original 6-D agent token.
- When enabled, each agent token appends:
  - route target delta normalized by map size: `[dx, dy]`
  - route target position normalized by map size: `[tx, ty]`
  - resulting agent observation shape: `[N, 10]`.
- The route targets come from `CoverageTask`'s persistent route state:
  - `task_state["route_hint_targets"]`
  - updated when the route-hint field is built.
- Added BC warm-start compatibility filtering in `scripts/train_bc.py`:
  - only loads checkpoint tensors whose keys and shapes match the current model;
  - skips mismatched tensors such as the first agent encoder layer when agent observation size changes.
- Added configs:
  - `configs/env/debug_coverage_route_target_agents_canonical.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_route_target_agents_perm.yaml`
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_route_target_agents_safe.yaml`
- Reason:
  - route-hint shared heatmap did not give a reliable per-agent route pointer.
  - V5 teacher is strong because each agent has its own persistent route index; appending target coordinates gives the per-agent actor this missing information without hidden mutable policy state.

Phase60 route-target-agent BC result:

- Fixed `CentralizedMultiUAVEnv` observation space shape for optional agent extensions:
  - `spaces.Box(shape=agent_low.shape)` instead of hard-coded `(num_agents, 6)`.
- Tests:
  - `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_task_fields.py tests/test_variable_policies.py tests/test_policy_action_distribution.py`
  - Result: `31 passed`.
- Generated V5 teacher data with per-agent route target features:
  - dataset: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase60_coverage_route_target_agents/v5_route_target_agents_canonical_e120.npz`
  - samples: `20210`
  - episodes: `120`
  - terminal success: `0.641667`
  - agent tensor shape: `(20210, 4, 10)`
  - mean absolute route delta features: `0.118764`
- BC run:
  - run: `outputs/training/bc/20260601_034310/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_route_target_agents_perm_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`
  - config: `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_route_target_agents_perm.yaml`
  - env: `configs/env/debug_coverage_route_target_agents_canonical.yaml`
  - init: V5-BC no-route checkpoint, with only `agent_encoder.0.weight` skipped due shape mismatch.
- Final 50-episode eval:
  - `success_rate=0.66`
  - `coverage_ratio=0.797840`
  - `collision_rate=0.005549`
  - `path_length=0.882761`
  - `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.986634`
  - `demand_revisit_excess=23.928779`
  - `return=19.242915`
- Interpretation:
  - This is the first coverage learning result that matches the V5 teacher success scale.
  - The decisive fix is not a scalar reward tweak; it is exposing per-agent persistent route targets to the actor while keeping centralized global context.
  - This supports the user's requested decision model: each agent receives its own waypoint-relevant target, while policy/critic still share full state.

Phase60 route-target-agent PPO result:

- PPO run:
  - run: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260601_phase60_coverage_route_target_agents_ppo/phase60_coverage_route_target_agents_ppo/`
  - init checkpoint: `outputs/training/bc/20260601_034310/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_route_target_agents_perm_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/checkpoints/checkpoint_0032.pt`
  - config: `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_route_target_agents_safe.yaml`
  - env: `configs/env/debug_coverage_route_target_agents_canonical.yaml`
- PPO periodic eval:
  - update 20: `success_rate=0.667`
  - update 40: `success_rate=0.667`
  - update 60: `success_rate=0.667`
  - update 80: `success_rate=0.667`
  - update 100: `success_rate=0.667`
  - interpretation: conservative PPO preserved the BC expert; no PPO collapse.
- PPO final 30-episode eval:
  - `success_rate=0.666667`
  - `coverage_ratio=0.803509`
  - `collision_rate=0.001875`
  - `path_length=0.900458`
  - `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.986835`
  - `demand_revisit_excess=24.186381`
  - `return=23.276407`
- Independent best-checkpoint 100-episode eval:
  - CSV: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase60_coverage_route_target_agents/eval_phase60_best_route_target_100ep/coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`
  - checkpoint: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260601_phase60_coverage_route_target_agents_ppo/phase60_coverage_route_target_agents_ppo/checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt`

  - `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.986430`
  - `demand_revisit_excess=23.424259`
  - `return=35.787137`
- Current coverage conclusion:
  - Under the new per-agent route-target decision mode, coverage is now functioning and PPO fine-tuning is stable.
  - This is not the original canonical `configs/env/coverage.yaml`; it is a coverage environment/observation design change explicitly allowed by the user for coverage debugging.

## Theme AM: formation template-aware success repair and 100-episode validation

Implemented on 2026-06-01:

- Fixed `FormationTask.get_metrics(...)` success logic in `tasks/formation.py`.
- Previous issue:
  - formation success required low slot error, low radius error, and high angular uniformity for every template.
  - This is valid for radial templates such as `circle` and `diamond`.
  - It is structurally wrong for `line` and too strict for `arc`, because those templates are not angularly uniform around the center even when UAVs exactly match their assigned slots.
- New success logic:
  - all templates require `formation_error <= formation_tolerance`;
  - `circle` and `diamond` additionally require radius error and angular uniformity;
  - `arc` additionally requires radius error;
  - `line` uses slot matching error as the success condition.
- Added regression test:
  - `tests/test_rewards_basic.py::test_formation_line_template_success_uses_slot_error_not_angular_uniformity`
  - It places UAVs exactly on a line template, confirms angular uniformity is below the old radial threshold, and confirms success is now true.
- Test command:
  - `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_rewards_basic.py tests/test_variable_policies.py tests/test_policy_action_distribution.py`
  - Result: `35 passed`.

Formation phase61 validation:

- Baseline before success-definition repair:
  - checkpoint: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase39_formation_factorized_group_ppo/phase39_formation_factorized_group_ppo/checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt`
  - CSV: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase61_formation_validation/eval_phase39_best_100ep/formation_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`
  - 100 episodes, seed 7
  - `success_rate=0.50`
  - `formation_error=0.067085`
  - `radius_error=0.055980`
  - `angular_coverage_uniformity=0.601650`
  - `collision_rate=0.002550`
  - `path_length=0.540066`
  - `return=28.816939`
- After template-aware success repair, same checkpoint:
  - CSV: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase61_formation_validation/eval_phase39_best_template_success_100ep/formation_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`
  - 100 episodes, seed 7
  - `success_rate=0.77`
  - `formation_error=0.072942`
  - `radius_error=0.055500`
  - `angular_coverage_uniformity=0.633523`
  - `collision_rate=0.002313`
  - `path_length=0.446007`
  - `return=29.534165`
- Repeat seed validation:
  - added `configs/env/debug_formation_seed23.yaml`
  - CSV: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase61_formation_validation/eval_phase39_best_template_success_seed23_100ep/formation_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`
  - 100 episodes, seed 23
  - `success_rate=0.78`
  - `formation_error=0.073723`
  - `radius_error=0.055759`
  - `angular_coverage_uniformity=0.639514`
  - `collision_rate=0.002313`
  - `path_length=0.439148`
  - `return=29.182813`

Current formation conclusion:

- Formation is now repaired under the `factorized_group` specialist path.
- The repair is primarily a task-metric correctness fix, not a PPO hyperparameter fix.
- The same phase39 checkpoint now has coverage-level verification strength: two independent 100-episode evaluations with `success_rate≈0.77-0.78`, low collision, and stable formation error.

## Theme AN: risk_nav repeat-seed validation after formation phase61

Implemented on 2026-06-01:

- Added repeat-seed eval config:
  - `configs/env/debug_risk_nav_seed23.yaml`
  - It keeps the phase41 risk-nav task, obstacle/risk settings, and reward weights unchanged.
  - Only the seed is changed to `23`; this is a validation config, not an environment/reward tuning change.
- Evaluated phase41 best `factorized_group` checkpoint:
  - checkpoint: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase41_risknav_factorized_group_dagger_safe/phase41_risknav_factorized_group_dagger_safe/checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt`
  - policy config: `configs/policy/debug_ppo_risk_nav_factorized_group_dagger_safe.yaml`
  - eval env: `configs/env/debug_risk_nav_seed23.yaml`
  - output CSV: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase62_risknav_validation/eval_phase41_best_seed23_100ep/risk_nav_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`

Phase62 result:

- `success_rate=0.65`
- `goal_coverage_ratio=0.841667`
- `collision_rate=0.018796`
- `path_length=0.712840`
- `cumulative_risk_exposure=34.320727`
- `safety_violation_count=39.08`
- `return=3.544033`

Comparison with previous seed 7 100-episode eval:

- seed 7 CSV: `outputs/debug_long/20260530_factorized_group_continuation/eval_phase41_risknav_100ep/risk_nav_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`
- seed 7 metrics: `success_rate=0.65`, `goal_coverage_ratio=0.85`, `collision_rate=0.020797`, `path_length=0.698778`, `cumulative_risk_exposure=33.393036`.
- seed 23 reproduces the same success level and similar safety/path metrics.

Current risk_nav conclusion:

- `risk_nav` should now be treated as repaired/reproducible under the phase41 `factorized_group` specialist path.
- It is not as clean as `goal_nav` or `formation`: success is stable at about `0.65`, and cumulative risk/safety violation metrics remain non-trivial.
- The effective recipe remains learner-state DAgger BC plus conservative PPO with reference regularization, not pure PPO from scratch.

Post-phase62 regression tests:

- Command: `/opt/conda/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_rewards_basic.py tests/test_variable_policies.py tests/test_policy_action_distribution.py`
- Result: `35 passed in 4.88s`.

## Theme AO: coverage route-target repeat-seed validation

Implemented on 2026-06-01:

- Added repeat-seed coverage eval config:
  - `configs/env/debug_coverage_route_target_agents_seed23.yaml`
  - It keeps the phase60 route-target-agent coverage task design, reward weights, success ratio, demand quantile, and route hint settings unchanged.
  - Only the seed is changed to `23`; this is a validation config, not a new coverage tuning change.
- Evaluated phase60 best `factorized_group` checkpoint:
  - checkpoint: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260601_phase60_coverage_route_target_agents_ppo/phase60_coverage_route_target_agents_ppo/checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt`

Phase63 result:

- `success_rate=0.68`
- `coverage_ratio=0.795507`
- `collision_rate=0.004842`
- `path_length=0.879962`
- `repeated_coverage_ratio=0.986651`
- `demand_revisit_excess=23.553093`
- `return=22.621489`

Comparison with previous phase60 seed 7 100-episode eval:

- seed 7 CSV: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase60_coverage_route_target_agents/eval_phase60_best_route_target_100ep/coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id.csv`
- seed 7 metrics: `success_rate=0.72`, `coverage_ratio=0.801508`, `collision_rate=0.002905`, `path_length=0.881318`, `demand_revisit_excess=23.424259`.
- seed 23 is slightly lower success but reproduces the same general behavior: high coverage ratio, low collision, similar path length, and similar demand revisit excess.

Current coverage conclusion:

- Coverage is now repaired/reproducible under the new per-agent route-target observation/decision mode.
- Two independent 100-episode seeds give `success_rate=0.68-0.72`.
- The main remaining quality issue is still repeated coverage (`repeated_coverage_ratio≈0.986`) and `demand_revisit_excess≈23.5`; this is not blocking expert usability but is the next improvement target if coverage quality must be raised further.

## Theme AP: goal_nav repeat-seed audit

Implemented on 2026-06-01:

- Added repeat-seed goal_nav eval config:
  - `configs/env/debug_goal_nav_seed23.yaml`
  - It keeps the phase36 goal-nav env settings unchanged except for `seed: 23`.
- Evaluated phase36 best `factorized_group` checkpoint:

Phase64 result:

- `success_rate=0.66`

Comparison with previous phase36 seed 7 evidence:

- training final/best eval seed 7: `success_rate=0.80`, `goal_coverage_ratio=0.8725`, `collision_rate=0.063120`, `path_length=0.486920`.
- `eval_best_50` seed 7: `success_rate=0.78`, `goal_coverage_ratio=0.877`, `collision_rate=0.056029`, `path_length=0.510952`.

Current goal_nav conclusion:

- `goal_nav` remains usable under `factorized_group`, but the new seed 23 100-episode audit shows weaker robustness than previously assumed.
- Do not overstate goal_nav as two-seed high-stability: current evidence is seed 7 `0.78-0.80` vs seed 23 `0.66`.
- The main remaining issue is collision/safety and seed generalization, not basic task learning.
- If strict four-task robustness is required before multi-task training, next best action is a short safety/generalization continuation from phase36 with conservative PPO and possibly stronger collision/obstacle reward, then re-evaluate both seed 7 and seed 23.

Documentation update:

- Added `docs/specialist_expert_baselines_zh.md`.
- Purpose: freeze the current single-task specialist baseline table before downstream multi-task work.
- The table lists each task's reusable checkpoint, policy config, env/eval config, main evidence, and caveat.

## Theme AQ: goal_nav phase65 safety/generalization continuation

Implemented on 2026-06-01:

- Added safety/generalization continuation env:
  - `configs/env/debug_goal_nav_seed23_safety.yaml`
  - Same goal-nav task setup as phase36/phase64 seed23, but with stronger reward penalties for `collision`, `obstacle_collision`, and `safety_violation`.
  - This is a reward-only hardening experiment; task success threshold and task mechanics are unchanged.
- Added conservative reference-PPO config:
  - `configs/policy/debug_ppo_goal_nav_factorized_group_safety_ref.yaml`
  - Main differences from phase36:
    - `learning_rate=5e-6`
    - `clip_coef=0.01`
    - `target_kl=0.001`
    - `reference_policy_coef=0.75`
    - `total_updates=80`
- PPO continuation command:
  - `/opt/conda/bin/python scripts/train_ppo.py --config configs/policy/debug_ppo_goal_nav_factorized_group_safety_ref.yaml --env-config configs/env/debug_goal_nav_seed23_safety.yaml --tasks goal_nav --agent_counts 4 --scaling_mode fixed_map --init_checkpoint outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase36_goalnav_factorized_group_ppo/phase36_goalnav_factorized_group_ppo/checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt --obs_variant multi_channel_field+task_id --eval_episodes 30 --total_updates 80 --headless --run_timestamp 20260601_phase65_goalnav_safety_ref --run_name phase65_goalnav_safety_ref`
- PPO run:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260601_phase65_goalnav_safety_ref/phase65_goalnav_safety_ref/`
  - best checkpoint: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260601_phase65_goalnav_safety_ref/phase65_goalnav_safety_ref/checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt`
  - best training eval: update 60, `eval_success_rate=0.766667`, `eval_reward=6.130733`.

  - `success_rate=0.72`
  - `goal_coverage_ratio=0.824500`
  - `collision_rate=0.065032`
  - `path_length=0.536958`
  - `completion_time=121.82`
  - `remaining_goal_ratio=0.175500`
  - `return=6.916867`

Interpretation:

- Phase65 improves the weak seed23 audit relative to phase36:
  - `success_rate: 0.66 -> 0.71`
  - `collision_rate: 0.072423 -> 0.064165`
  - `goal_coverage_ratio: 0.804167 -> 0.824667`
- But it lowers seed7 relative to phase36:
  - phase36 seed7 was `success_rate=0.78-0.80`;
  - phase65 seed7 is `success_rate=0.72`.
- Therefore phase65 is a robustness alternative, not an unconditional replacement for phase36.
- Keep phase36 as the best seed7/high-success checkpoint; use phase65 if balanced seed7/seed23 behavior matters more than peak seed7 success.
