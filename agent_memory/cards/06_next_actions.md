# 建议的下一步工作

## 高优先级

### 1. 转移主线到 coverage specialist 修复

建议：

- 继续 coverage 的 expert-v2 BC -> spatial-head PPO 主线
- 优先观察 `coverage_ratio` 是否能稳定跨过 `0.5`、`0.6`、再接近 `0.82`
- 当前 best-final coverage PPO 已经把 specialist 推到更高一点的成功区：
  - best eval `success≈0.15`
  - `coverage_ratio≈0.673`
  - `collision≈0.00019`
  - run root:
    `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260529_phase24_coverage_successonly_v2_bestfinal/phase24_coverage_successonly_v2_bestfinal/`
- 当前更具体的 coverage 主线是：
  - `expert-v2 dataset -> spatial-head BC -> spatial-head PPO`
  - 如果继续推进，优先用成功策略轨迹继续做 success-heavy BC / DAgger，而不是继续单纯加 reward scale
  - 这条成功轨迹强化链已经做过一轮：success-heavy BC、sector-bias、stronger-repulsion 都没有超过 `phase10`
  - 因此下一步应升级到真正的 group-level coordination actor，而不是继续做轻量偏置微调
- canonical heuristic BC 只保留为结构探针，不作为 coverage 主线

原因：

- `goal_nav` 当前已经有一条可复用 specialist 收敛链，并且 PPO final eval 已稳定在 `success_rate_mean=0.8`
- `coverage` 现在才是剩余的主要阻塞项
- 可选 `global slot head` 已经接入代码并通过跨任务兼容性测试，因此真正的 group-level actor 分支现在具备可实验条件

### 2. 刷新正式 verification 文件

建议：

- 重新生成一个和当前目录结构、测试数量、命令入口一致的 `outputs/verification.md`

原因：

- 当前文件已明显陈旧，会误导后续 agent 和用户

### 3. 统一配置命名

建议：

- 在 `ppo_mlp / mlp_ppo`
- `ppo_cnn_deepsets / cnn_deepsets_ppo`

两套命名中选一套作为主路径，并把另一套标记为 legacy 或 alias。

原因：

- 当前重复命名已经进入维护负担区间

### 4. 为评估脚本补 `--latest`

建议：

- 给 `evaluate_policy.py` 和 `evaluate_scaling.py` 增加最新 run 自动发现

原因：

- 训练目录现在有时间层，手工填 checkpoint 路径更容易出错

## 中优先级

### 5. 在 coverage 主线稳定后，再刷新 canonical specialist / multitask runs

建议：

- 用当前新的 `checkpoints/` 与 `snapshot/` 规范，跑一条标准多任务 PPO 训练线
- 同时保留 eval media 和 final eval artifacts

原因：

- 这样后续所有 agent 都能引用“新结构下的标准 run”

### 6. 为 agent_memory 增加自动生成脚本

建议：

- 后续可考虑增加脚本，把当前测试数、最新 run、最新 checkpoint 自动写回 manifest 或某张卡

原因：

- 当前 memory cards 是人工审计产物，后面若频繁修改，自动刷新会更稳

## 低优先级

### 7. 处理 `sitecustomize.py` 重复

建议：

- 明确是否保留双副本

### 8. 历史 outputs 分层归档

建议：

- 把旧结构 run 和新结构 run 分层标记

原因：

- 未来自动扫 `outputs/` 做比较时会更干净

## 路由建议

如果后续 agent 需要继续主线开发，建议优先路线是：

1. Keep `goal_nav` factorized-group as repaired:
   `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase36_goalnav_factorized_group_ppo/phase36_goalnav_factorized_group_ppo/checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt`.
2. Keep `formation` factorized-group as provisionally repaired:
   `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase39_formation_factorized_group_ppo/phase39_formation_factorized_group_ppo/checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt`.
3. Risk-nav under factorized-group is still not repaired:
   current best 50-episode eval is `success_rate_mean=0.24`, with collision `≈0.177`.
4. Next risk-nav route should not be simple repulsion/reference or low-collision-only BC; both failed.
5. For risk-nav, try a richer DAgger dataset from learner states relabeled by the risk heuristic, or add a task-specific risk/goal spatial head while keeping `policy_class: factorized_group`.
6. Coverage remains unresolved under h200 and weaker than old h300 under new architecture:
   new factorized-group h300 best is `success_rate_mean=0.40`; old spatial-head h300 best is `0.56`.
7. For coverage, next new-architecture route is group-specific coverage suppression or persistent group targets, not more heuristic V4/band-sweep data.
8. Refresh `outputs/verification.md`, checkpoint latest helpers, and canonical multitask runs after risk_nav and coverage have new-architecture specialists.

## 当前 continuation 路线：只推进 factorized_group

约束：

- 不再调旧 `CNNDeepSetsPolicy` 主线。
- 不改环境动力学、任务定义、成功阈值或核心任务要素。
- 允许 reward-only 配置实验，但必须显式记录为 debug/training config。

立即执行：

1. `risk_nav`: 用 `scripts/debug_long/collect_dagger_dataset.py` 从 factorized-group learner rollout 采样状态，并用 heuristic teacher relabel，输出到 `outputs/debug_long/20260530_factorized_group_continuation/`。
2. `risk_nav`: 用原 success dataset + DAgger dataset 训练 factorized-group BC，再用 `configs/policy/debug_ppo_risk_nav_factorized_group_dagger_safe.yaml` 和 `configs/env/debug_risk_nav_safety_completion.yaml` 做保守 PPO。
3. `coverage`: 从 factorized-group h300 best checkpoint 继续 completion-focused PPO，判断剩余问题是 episode budget/credit assignment 还是架构表达不足。
4. 每个新增数据集、训练 run、代码或配置修改都必须同步写回 `agent_memory/cards/03_recent_modifications.md` 和本卡。

Risk-nav continuation update:

- DAgger BC improved factorized-group risk-nav to 30-episode `success_rate_mean=0.533`, but collision remains high at `0.114`.
- Next action is conservative PPO from `outputs/training/bc/20260530_121227/debug_bc_risk_nav_factorized_group_risk_nav_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/checkpoints/checkpoint_0040.pt` using `configs/policy/debug_ppo_risk_nav_factorized_group_dagger_safe.yaml` and `configs/env/debug_risk_nav_safety_completion.yaml`.

Risk-nav status after phase41:

- Treat `risk_nav` as provisionally repaired under `factorized_group`.
- Current best checkpoint: `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260530_phase41_risknav_factorized_group_dagger_safe/phase41_risknav_factorized_group_dagger_safe/checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt`.
- Evidence: independent 100-episode eval `success_rate_mean=0.65`, `collision_rate_mean=0.0208`.
- Remaining validation: run at least one seed repeat after coverage is stabilized.

Coverage next:

- Do not use h300 as the canonical success claim because the user disallowed environment changes except reward.
- Continue with h200 and reward-only completion shaping first.

Coverage h200 experiment to run:

- Start from factorized-group coverage BC checkpoint `outputs/training/bc/20260530_083743/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_perm_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/checkpoints/checkpoint_0024.pt`.
- Train with `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_completion_h200.yaml` and `configs/env/debug_coverage_completion_focus.yaml`.
- Evaluate with at least 30 episodes during training and 100 episodes for the best checkpoint before claiming repair.

Coverage phase42 result:

- Direct utility-slot PPO failed and was stopped early.
- Do not continue phase42.
- Next action: train BC with the utility-enabled factorized-group policy on the existing coverage dataset, then PPO fine-tune from that BC checkpoint.

Coverage utility BC result:

- Utility-head BC failed despite low supervised loss: 30-episode success `0.0`.
- Do not PPO from `outputs/training/bc/20260530_135952/...`.
- Next action: coverage learner-state DAgger using phase37 factorized-group coverage learner as rollout policy and `coverage_expert_v2` as teacher, then BC/PPO with the original non-utility factorized-group config.

Coverage teacher diagnostic result:

- Existing coverage teachers are not h200-successful; do not expect expert-v2/v3/v4 DAgger alone to solve coverage.
- Next action: run `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_h200_stable.yaml` from the original factorized-group coverage BC checkpoint under `configs/env/debug_coverage_completion_focus.yaml`.

Coverage phase43 result:

- Stable h200 PPO from original BC did not exceed the original `0.20` success baseline.
- Current best canonical h200 factorized-group coverage remains around `success_rate_mean=0.20`.
- Next route should be reward-only coverage curriculum/shaping or a newly designed high-success h200 coverage teacher; do not repeat expert-v2/v3/v4 DAgger or utility-head PPO as-is.

Coverage ratio-curriculum next:

- Run `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_h200_ratio_curriculum.yaml` from the original factorized-group BC checkpoint under `configs/env/debug_coverage_ratio_curriculum.yaml`.
- If it improves success above `0.20`, do independent 100-episode eval. If not, coverage remains blocked on high-success h200 expert/curriculum design.

Coverage phase44 result:

- Ratio-curriculum reward-only PPO failed to improve beyond `0.20` baseline; best was `0.1667`.
- If using lower-threshold curriculum next, mark it explicitly as training-only/diagnostic and validate final checkpoint under canonical `coverage.success_ratio=0.82`, h200.

Coverage milestone PPO next:

- Run `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_h200_milestone.yaml` with `configs/env/debug_coverage_milestone_reward.yaml` from the original factorized-group BC checkpoint.
- If best 30-episode success exceeds `0.20`, run 100-episode canonical eval. If it fails, coverage remains blocked on stronger curriculum/high-success h200 expert design.

Coverage phase45 canonical validation:

- Milestone PPO is not a canonical repair. Canonical 100-episode success was `0.17` with repeated coverage ratio `0.991`.
- Next credible route: implement an anti-revisit / frontier-sweep training signal or a high-success h200 teacher, then validate under original `configs/env/coverage.yaml`.

Coverage anti-revisit PPO next:

- Run `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_h200_antirevisit.yaml` with `configs/env/debug_coverage_antirevisit_reward.yaml` from the original factorized-group BC checkpoint.
- Canonical validation remains mandatory under `configs/env/coverage.yaml`.

Coverage phase46 canonical validation:

- Anti-revisit PPO is not a canonical repair. Canonical 100-episode success is `0.20`, repeated coverage remains `0.99125`.
- Stop repeating scalar reward-only PPO from the same BC checkpoint.
- Next credible implementation: add a factorized-group-compatible persistent target/frontier assignment mechanism or create a true high-success h200 coverage teacher, then validate under canonical `configs/env/coverage.yaml`.

Coverage success-heavy BC result:

- Success-only BC from phase46 successful trajectories failed: 50-episode canonical success `0.140`.
- Stop using current success-only data as the main coverage fix.
- Next implementation should be architectural but compatible with `factorized_group`: persistent per-agent/group frontier target assignment, or alternatively build a true h200 coverage teacher before BC/PPO.

Post-continuation status:

- Regression tests passed: `26 passed`.
- Do not claim coverage repaired. Current canonical h200 coverage is still around `0.20` success.
- Best next coverage route is not another scalar reward tweak; implement persistent per-agent/group frontier targets in the new architecture, or first build a true high-success h200 coverage teacher.

Coverage frontier-slot next:

- Train `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_frontier_perm.yaml` on `outputs/debug_long/20260530_factorized_group_continuation/coverage_success_from_phase46_canonical_plus_v3.npz`.
- If BC canonical eval is not worse than baseline, run `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_frontier.yaml` under canonical or anti-revisit reward and validate with canonical 100 episodes.

Coverage frontier-low next:

- Run `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_frontier_low.yaml` from the original coverage BC checkpoint under anti-revisit reward.
- If it does not exceed `0.20`, frontier bias as currently implemented should be considered ineffective and the next route should be a better h200 teacher rather than more frontier tuning.

Coverage frontier-low result:

- Phase48 failed and was stopped early. Low-strength frontier bias did not preserve baseline behavior.
- The next coverage path should be a high-success h200 teacher/trajectory generator, not additional frontier-bias tuning.

Coverage teacher prototype result:

- Local greedy and waypoint-lookahead h200 teacher prototypes failed.
- If continuing coverage, build an explicit route-planning/sweep teacher or add recurrent/persistent target memory with proper state handling; do not rely on local greedy scoring.

Frontier continuation verification:

- Regression tests passed: `28 passed`.
- No active training/evaluation process is running.
- Coverage is still unresolved; current implemented frontier bias is compatible but empirically ineffective.

Documentation update:

- Current explanation of pure PPO unreliability and BC/DAgger necessity is in `docs/specialist_ppo_reliability_zh.md`.
- Future agents should read that doc before proposing another pure-PPO or scalar reward-only coverage run.

Coverage curriculum v1 next:

- Run `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_train_curriculum_v1.yaml` under `configs/env/debug_coverage_train_curriculum_v1.yaml` from original factorized-group coverage BC checkpoint.
- First criterion: modified training-env reward and success should rise clearly.
- Second criterion: if training-env succeeds, evaluate transfer under canonical `configs/env/coverage.yaml` separately.

Coverage phase49 result:

- Modified training env converged: 100-episode success `0.73`.
- Canonical transfer failed: 100-episode success `0.14`.
- Next action: bridge curriculum closer to canonical, starting from phase49 best checkpoint.

Coverage phase50 result:

- Bridge v2 100-episode success is `0.56`; phase49 v1 remains the better converged modified training env at `0.73`.
- Canonical transfer remains poor (`0.13`).
- If the user wants convergence in modified coverage training env, phase49 is currently the best. If canonical transfer is required, next route must change coverage task design more substantially or add route-planning supervision.

Coverage curriculum verification:

- Regression tests passed: `29 passed`.
- No active training/evaluation process is running.

Coverage phase51 next:

- Run `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_seq_frontier_antirepeat.yaml` under `configs/env/debug_coverage_train_curriculum_v3_antirepeat.yaml`.
- Recommended init checkpoint: phase50 bridge best:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260531_phase50_coverage_train_curriculum_v2_bridge/phase50_coverage_train_curriculum_v2_bridge/checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt`
- This is the first real frontier-enabled factorized-group run after fixing policy factory propagation for `coverage_frontier_*`.
- Track success rate, `coverage_ratio`, `collision_rate`, `path_length`, `repeated_coverage_ratio`, and new `demand_revisit_excess`.
- If phase51 reward is very negative but success/coverage rise and revisit metrics drop, that is expected under the stronger anti-repeat reward. Do not reject the run by return alone.
- If success collapses below phase50, reduce `repeated_demand_coverage` first (e.g. `-3.0`) before changing architecture; keep sequential group context on for this branch.

Coverage phase52 next:

- Phase51 collapsed and was stopped. Do not resume it unless specifically diagnosing frontier behavior.
- Run phase52 from phase50 bridge best:
  - Env: `configs/env/debug_coverage_train_curriculum_v3_moderate_antirepeat.yaml`
  - Policy: `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_seq_moderate_antirepeat.yaml`
- First eval criterion at update 20:
  - should be closer to phase50 bridge (`success≈0.50`) than phase51 (`success=0.133`);
  - repeated metrics may remain high initially, but `coverage_ratio` should not drop below `0.72`.
- If phase52 still collapses, the issue is likely architecture perturbation from newly inserted sequential parameters; next fallback is same moderate anti-repeat env with `use_sequential_group_context=false`, then only later re-enable sequential after BC/refit.

Coverage phase53 next:

- Phase52 confirmed that weak sequential context still damages the phase50 checkpoint.
- Run phase53:
  - Env: `configs/env/debug_coverage_train_curriculum_v3_moderate_antirepeat.yaml`
  - Policy: `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_moderate_antirepeat.yaml`
  - Init: phase50 bridge best.
- Criterion:
  - update 20 should stay near control eval `success=0.50`, `coverage≈0.747`;
  - if it stays stable, continue to update 160 and compare revisit metrics against the control eval (`repeated≈0.9913`, `demand_revisit_excess≈28.14`);
  - if success drops, anti-repeat PPO is itself destabilizing and needs either lower LR/reference_coef stronger or BC/DAgger on successful anti-repeat trajectories.

Coverage phase54 next:

- Phase53 dropped below the phase50 control and was stopped.
- Run phase54:
  - Env: `configs/env/debug_coverage_train_curriculum_v3_moderate_antirepeat.yaml`
  - Policy: `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_moderate_antirepeat_safe.yaml`
  - Init: phase50 bridge best.
- At update 20, compare against control eval:
  - target `success_rate >= 0.45`;
  - `coverage_ratio >= 0.74`;
  - revisit metrics should not increase above phase50 control (`repeated≈0.9913`, `demand_revisit_excess≈28.14`).
- If phase54 cannot preserve success, stop reward-PPO continuation and switch to data-side repair: collect successful low-revisit trajectories under phase50/v1 curricula, then BC/refit before PPO.

Coverage phase54 result:

- Phase54 is the current best modified-env continuation:
  - v3 moderate 100-episode success `0.56`;
  - phase50 control on same env `0.50`;
  - return improved from `-64.43` to `-44.03`;
  - `demand_revisit_excess` improved from `28.14` to `27.36`.
- Canonical transfer did not improve:
  - phase54 canonical 100-episode success `0.12`;
  - phase50 canonical was `0.13`.

Coverage next after phase54:

- Do not claim canonical coverage solved.
- Best next route is a closer-to-canonical safe continuation from phase54 best:
  - keep original factorized-group architecture;
  - keep conservative PPO settings from phase54;
  - use `demand_quantile` closer to canonical/default (`0.57` or `0.55`) and `success_ratio=0.81-0.82`;
  - keep anti-repeat terms moderate, not huge.
- Alternative route if bridge still fails: collect successful low-revisit trajectories from phase54/v3 moderate and refit with BC before any sequential group context experiment.

Coverage phase55 result:

- Phase55 canonical bridge completed with best/final 30-episode success `0.30`.
- It is below phase54 v3-moderate (`0.56`) and does not repair canonical coverage.
- Do not keep extending phase55 with PPO; route/horizon generalization is the blocker.

Coverage next after phase55:

- Data-side repair is now the recommended path:
  - collect trajectories from phase54 best and phase55 best on v3-moderate and v4-bridge envs;
  - filter for success and lower `demand_revisit_excess`;
  - train/refit factorized-group BC on these trajectories;
  - then use phase54-safe PPO settings for short continuation.
- If implementing sequential/group decision again, first make its added path zero-impact at initialization or train it with BC; direct PPO warm-start damaged behavior in phase51/52.

Coverage phase56 result:

- Current-policy low-revisit success-only BC/refit did not improve v4 bridge:
  - BC/refit final success `0.30`, same as phase55.
- Do not repeat the same success-only BC filtering loop with current policy trajectories.

Coverage next after phase56:

- Build a stronger coverage teacher, preferably route-planning/sweep based.
- Requirements for a useful teacher before BC:
  - v4 bridge success clearly above `0.5`;
  - canonical success above current `0.12-0.20` baseline;
  - lower `demand_revisit_excess` than phase54/55 where possible.
- If teacher prototype cannot meet this, prioritize implementing persistent group/frontier target memory in the policy or environment observation rather than more scalar PPO tuning.

Coverage phase57 result:

- V5 sweep teacher meets the teacher-quality requirement:
  - canonical diagnostic success `0.66`;
  - v4 bridge diagnostic success `0.82`;
  - collision `0`;
  - much lower `demand_revisit_excess≈23.7`.
- BC from V5 data still only reaches canonical `success=0.30`, despite `coverage_ratio=0.759`.

Coverage next after phase57:

- Implement persistence in the decision mechanism:
  - persistent per-agent or per-group coverage target/route memory;
  - zero-impact default, compatible with existing `factorized_group`;
  - should use current observation's visited/demand channels to keep or advance targets.
- After implementing persistence:
  - first evaluate deterministic untrained/teacher-like target bias on canonical;
  - then BC on V5 data;
  - then short phase54-safe PPO.

Coverage phase58 result:

- Stateless lawnmower route head failed:
  - phase54 + route head canonical success `0.033`;
  - route-head BC epoch4 canonical success `0.133`;
  - both worse than V5 BC without route head (`0.30`).
- Do not continue this exact route-head branch.

Coverage next after phase58:

- If staying within feed-forward Gym policy, keep V5 teacher as an expert baseline/data source but do not expect BC to fully imitate persistence.
- For a real fix, add one of:
  - recurrent policy state;
  - environment observation channels for persistent assigned target/route progress;
  - wrapper-level stateful policy for coverage experts.
- Any such change must be marked architectural and tested for PPO logprob consistency, because mutable memory inside `forward()` is unsafe for PPO minibatch replay.

Coverage phase59 next:

- Use the newly implemented route-hint observation path, not the failed phase58 stateless lawnmower head.
- First verification:
  - run targeted tests for coverage route hints and factorized-group route-hint policy support.
- Diagnostic:
  - evaluate whether a phase54/V5-BC checkpoint plus `use_coverage_route_hint_head` can use `configs/env/debug_coverage_route_hint_canonical.yaml`.
  - Report success, coverage, collision, path length, repeated coverage, and `demand_revisit_excess`.
- Data path if diagnostic is viable:
  - regenerate V5 teacher data under `configs/env/debug_coverage_route_hint_canonical.yaml` so observations include the persistent route-hint channel;
  - BC with `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_route_hint_perm.yaml`;
  - then conservative PPO with `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_route_hint_safe.yaml`.
- Validation rule:
  - route-hint env is a coverage task-design change, not original canonical `configs/env/coverage.yaml`.
  - Keep both results separate; do not claim original canonical coverage is solved unless original canonical eval improves independently.

Coverage phase59 update:

- Direct route-hint bias on phase54/V5-BC checkpoints failed (`success_rate=0.0`), including after sequential suppression.
- Do not keep tuning direct route-hint strength against old checkpoints.
- Next concrete step:
  - generate V5 teacher data under `configs/env/debug_coverage_route_hint_canonical.yaml`;
  - train `debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_route_hint_perm`;
  - evaluate under the same route-hint env and original canonical separately.

Coverage phase59 BC retry:

- The route-hint V5 dataset is available and teacher quality is acceptable (`terminal_success≈0.642`).
- Retry BC after the route-hint head pooling fix:
  - dataset: `outputs/debug_long/20260601_phase59_coverage_route_hint/v5_route_hint_canonical_e120.npz`
  - config: `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_route_hint_perm.yaml`
  - env: `configs/env/debug_coverage_route_hint_canonical.yaml`
  - init checkpoint: V5-BC no-route checkpoint `outputs/training/bc/20260601_022614/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_perm_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/checkpoints/checkpoint_0024.pt`

Coverage phase59 next after BC:

- Route-hint-head BC was only `success_rate=0.26`; do not PPO from it.
- Run route-hint-observation-only BC:
  - config: `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_route_hint_obs_perm.yaml`
  - same dataset/env/init checkpoint as above.
- If obs-only BC does not exceed `0.30`, route hints alone are not solving imitation; next better route is to encode per-agent route target coordinates in the agent observation or add a proper recurrent actor instead of a shared heatmap.

Coverage phase60 next:

- Route-hint obs-only BC was also `success_rate=0.26`; shared heatmap hints are not enough.
- Use the new per-agent route-target observation path:
  - generate V5 data with `configs/env/debug_coverage_route_target_agents_canonical.yaml`;
  - train `configs/policy/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_route_target_agents_perm.yaml`;
  - warm-start from V5-BC is allowed because `scripts/train_bc.py` now filters shape-mismatched tensors.
- If BC crosses `success_rate>0.40`, run conservative PPO with `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_route_target_agents_safe.yaml`.

Coverage phase60 update:

- Route-target-agent BC succeeded:
  - run: `outputs/training/bc/20260601_034310/debug_bc_coverage_factorized_group_route_target_agents_perm_coverage_N4_multi_channel_field_plus_task_id/`
  - final 50-episode success `0.66`, coverage `0.79784`, collision `0.00555`, demand revisit excess `23.93`.
- Next action:
  - run conservative PPO from checkpoint `checkpoint_0032.pt` using `configs/policy/debug_ppo_coverage_factorized_group_route_target_agents_safe.yaml` and `configs/env/debug_coverage_route_target_agents_canonical.yaml`.
  - Validate best PPO checkpoint with 100 episodes under the same route-target env.
  - Separately evaluate under original canonical only as an ablation; original canonical will not have the route-target agent features and is not expected to match this architecture.

Coverage phase60 final:

- Treat coverage as repaired under the new per-agent route-target observation/decision mode.
- Best checkpoint:
  - `outputs/training/bc_ppo/20260601_phase60_coverage_route_target_agents_ppo/phase60_coverage_route_target_agents_ppo/checkpoints/checkpoint_best_eval.pt`
- Independent 100-episode evidence:
  - `success_rate=0.72`
  - `coverage_ratio=0.801508`
  - `collision_rate=0.002905`
  - `path_length=0.881318`
  - `demand_revisit_excess=23.424259`
- Remaining coverage work:
  - optional repeat seed for robustness;
  - decide whether to migrate original canonical coverage to include route-target agent features by default, or keep it as a separate expert-training env.
- Next global task:
  - repeat/validate formation under factorized_group and update the repaired-specialist table, because formation was previously only provisionally repaired.
